ANGKASA is a provider platform of e-learning system using cloud computing technology. E-learning system provides many benefits such as flexibility and efficiency for learning activity. However, there are some disadvantages of the usage of e-learning system, i.e., there are still many institutions especially educational institutions that still implementing conventional- based of e-learning system which considered ineffective both in terms of cost and time for infrastructure. These disadvantages can be resolved by using cloud computing system. In this study, we are implementing cloud computing system using virtualization technology. There are two methods of virtualization used in this study, full virtualization or VM and container virtualization. In this study, we are comparing the performance of these two methods of virtualization using Apache Benchmarking tool. The study shows that the container virtualization method is better than the VM virtualization method in terms of serving requests for virtual e-learning system. © 2023 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
An overview on information assurance framework for smart government in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Utomo, Rio Guntur""},{""Penulis"":""Andrian, Rian""},{""Penulis"":""Wills, Gary""}]","This paper offers a solution concept to develop an IA framework for Smart Government. Smart Government is an extended model of eGovernment and is an attempt to use developing technology to realise unfulfilled promises from previous modernisation initiatives such as new public management and eGovernment. Since the implementation of Smart Government relying on ICT, an approach to protect any threat to the information and systems and assure the business continuity in the event of an is needed. As a result, information assurance (IA) should be taken into consideration. The basic goal of information assurance is to protect businesses by lowering risks connected with data and information systems and assuring business continuity. However, although there are some studies focused on IA for eGovernment in Indonesia, there is no study so far that has focused on IA for Smart Government in Indonesia. This paper provides an overview of the relationship between Smart Cities, Smart Governance, and Smart Government. Furthermore, because Smart Government is an extended model of eGovernment, this paper also formulates a solution concept to develop an IA framework for eGovernment further to be an IA framework for Smart Government. The solution is, by using the triangulation method, an IA framework for Smart Government can be developed by identifying IA factors for eGovernment, IoT, Big Data, and Open Data. Using the solution concept, the future framework can be used to support IA implementation for Smart Government in Indonesia.  © 2023 Author(s).","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]"

Manual labour is usually labour-intensive, has higher risks of musculoskeletal disorders, and produces frequent occurrences of errors and losses. Furthermore, the current studies of suitable concepts and test protocols for roof tile transportation at the manufacturing stage as well as their inspection systems are not practicable in Indonesia. There is also no study that has used the theory of inventive problem-solving (TRIZ) in the development of concepts and protocols for roof tile transportation and inspection systems. Using TRIZ as a supporting tool, this study investigated the development of a transportation system to be employed during the manufacturing of the roof tile and a test protocol for their usability in Indonesian companies to overcome this concern. The study included screening and scoring concepts and usability test protocols identified from the existing literature, with the support of TRIZ tools such as the engineering contradiction, contradiction matrix, and inventive principles. Thus, the finalised concept comprised a belt conveyor system (Inventive Principle 20: Continuity of Useful Action) with a flipping mechanism for transportation and a vision-based camera for inspection. Results of the study showed that the concept excelled in cost, durability, reliability, versatility, low risk to the product, efficiency, and safety. The t-test protocol (Inventive Principle 23: Feedback) was selected based on the results due to its versatility in testing efficiency, reliability, and productivity. It was concluded that this concept has the potential to alleviate roof tile workers of physical work and reduce the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. © 2023 by the authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Tourism Route Recommendation Using Reinforcement Learning,"[{""Penulis"":""Mubarak, Muhammad Ilham""},{""Penulis"":""Baizal Z.K.A.""}]","Tourism is a rapidly growing sector that has a significant impact on increasing a country's national income. Indonesia's GDP is expected to grow in the coming years, and tourism is a major contributor to this growth. To address the high demand for tourism, we propose a personalized tourism route recommendation system that can assist tourists in planning their itineraries. This problem can be modeled as a Traveling Salesman Problem, which can be approached using Markov Decision Processes and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we proposed a method for generating N-days tourism routes in the Special Region of Yogyakarta that involves using Q-learning to recommend routes. We have included time constraints in our approach to fit the tour into a specific time frame and adhere to the operating hours of tourist attractions. Additionally, our method uses the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to consider various attributes, such as rating, travel time, and cost, as cost functions to satisfy the user's custom desired needs and preferences. The proposed method was compared to the Firefly algorithm in multiple experiments to assess its performance and determine its optimality. The experiment results showed that the proposed method is 42.89% more optimal for generating the tour than the Firefly algorithm. © 2023 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Toward cooperative competitiveness for community development in Economic Society 5.0,"[{""Penulis"":""Wahyuningtyas, Ratri""},{""Penulis"":""Disastra, Ganjar""},{""Penulis"":""Rismayani, Risris""}]","Purpose: Economic Society 5.0 is the answer to the challenges of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 through the creation of new value from the development of advanced technology that aims to reduce the gap between human and economic problems. Excellent human resources and adequate digital infrastructure are requirements in an Economic Society 5.0. Cooperatives as community economic organizations are players in the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Because of low competitiveness, cooperatives cannot create new and sustainable income streams, particularly digitalization capabilities. This study aims to encourage the competitiveness of cooperatives in the West Java region, Indonesia, in an Economic Society 5.0 by identifying the correlation between digital capabilities, digital orientation, employee resistance, government support, digital innovation and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative method through surveys as data collection techniques by distributing questionnaires to 386 leaders of cooperatives in West Java. Hypothesis testing uses analysis technique of structural equation modeling with partial least squares tool. Findings: There are five hypotheses that are supported in the proposed model in this study. Digital orientation and government support have a positif and significant effect on digital innovation, in contrary; digital capability and employee resistance do not show any effect. Digital orientation, government support and digital capability also have a positive and significant effect on competitiveness. Meanwhile, employee resistance and digital innovation have no significant effect on competitiveness. Digital innovation was also found not to mediate the relationship between digital orientation, government support, digital capability and employee resistance with competitiveness. Originality/value: This study provides new insights into the study of cooperatives as community’s economic institutions. This study adds empirical evidence of the factors that influence the competitiveness of cooperative institutions in Indonesia as a driver of the community’s economy. This study also provides practical implications for the development of cooperative competitiveness in developing countries, particularly in Indonesia. © 2021, Ratri Wahyuningtyas, Ganjar Disastra and Risris Rismayani.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The growth of IT jobs has resulted in a remarkable change in all infrastructure, such as information, skills, and domains covered in IT job profiles. Unfortunately, job roles and skills in this field remain undefined. The gap between the supply and demand needs in the IT workforce must be filled immediately with an appropriate strategy. To fulfill industry needs, an in-depth analysis of IT job profiles is important. Therefore, it is important for educational programs to identify the competencies needed by the industry to update their output. This study aims to identify the job profiles required for IT job specialists by analyzing real-world job posts published online to identify hidden meanings from a textual database. A systematic semantic methodology was proposed using an average-linkage hierarchical clustering analysis. It resembles a tree structure technique to discover relevant phrases, relationships, and hidden meanings through semantic analysis. Occurrences of the most frequent words and phrases were extracted to reveal the domain knowledge of each IT job cluster. The result is a systematic semantic analysis of the IT job profile comprising the programming language, specialized type, duty, database, tools, and frameworks. The justification for each job profile was validated by 10 IT professionals from various private and government companies in Indonesia through Focus Group Discussions (FGD).  © 2013 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The results showed that the effect of these three phenomena on extreme rainfall in the IMC is significantly modulated by MJO conditions, with the magnitude of the impact varying among regions. The analysis was done by dividing into three groups: single events, double events, and three events. When CS occurs singly, there is an increase in PCE along the CS pathway from the southeastern Philippines when MJO is active and vice versa when MJO is inactive. However, there was an increase in PCE in several other areas in IMC when MJO was inactive. The pattern of PCE increase when CENS is single in active MJO is almost the same as during inactive MJO, namely from Java Island to Nusa Tenggara and along the Indian Ocean in the southern region of Java Island. However, the intensity is higher when the inactive MJO, which suggests that the role of the MJO is to reduce the influence of CENS on extreme rainfall in the area. The effect of BV in the South China Sea on extreme rainfall is higher when inactive MJO than active MJO due to the role of MJO in reducing the frequency of BV events. CS and CENS tend to attenuate their effects on oceanic rainfall extremes mutually. However, they mutually reinforced their influence on the mainland when the inactive MJO. CENS and BV reinforce each other’s influence on each other’s locations when active MJO. However, it’s the other way around when inactive MJO. CS and BV reinforce each other’s influence on extreme rainfall when they occur together, either when the MJO is active or inactive, but CS is more likely to strengthen the development of BV. MJO has the property of weakening the influence of CS + CENS + BV around Java Island and the southern IMC if they occur together. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Design and implementation of automatic solar water pumps for irrigation,"[{""Penulis"":""Maharani, Sarah""},{""Penulis"":""Aprillia, Bandiyah Sri""},{""Penulis"":""Pangaribuan, Porman""},{""Penulis"":""Aulia, Ananda Ayu""}]","Irrigation of rice fields can be done easily during the rainy season by utilizing irrigation water routes. During the dry season, farmers oftentimes use groundwater for irrigation. Water pumps that are commonly used when taking groundwater are typically powered by diesel or electrical grid from PLN. However, the long distance between energy sources and water pumps for irrigating rice fields is one of the obstacles in Mauk Village. Therefore, this study aims to design and implement a solar powered water pump for irrigation. Based on the research results, the 50 WP solar powered water pump can operate in sunny, overcast, and cloudy weather. The low intensity of solar radiation on cloudy days causes the irrigation time to be longer than sunny days. This is because the power output of the off grid solar power system is strongly influenced by the test weather conditions. In sunny conditions, the highest power resulted was 33.01 Watt, while in cloudy and overcast conditions the maximum power obtained was only 27.60 Watt and 24.34 Watt respectively. The output power of the solar panel also affects the amount of battery SOC that can be charged, the greater the power generated, the higher the percentage of the battery SOC. In addition, the cost savings for solar powered pumps equal to more than 90% compared to diesel water pumps.  © 2023 Author(s).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Capability Development to Generate Business Value Through Customer-centric Analytics in the Banking Industry: A Systematic Review,"[{""Penulis"":""Kristiana, Idha""},{""Penulis"":""Ramadhan, Arief""},{""Penulis"":""Trisetyarso, Agung""},{""Penulis"":""Abdurachman, Edi""},{""Penulis"":""Zarlis, Muhammad""}]","Data is growing significantly, and banks are one of the ecosystems that contribute to data growth. Data governance is a challenge in banks due to the high level of confidentiality and the involvement of regulators in data management and technology implementation. Big data requires technology to manage it, while technology investment is a challenge, namely how technology investment to manage big data can contribute to generating value in business. There are two main points in this study: the first is about building capability, and the second is generating value. Through the literature review, it is known that there are challenges to optimizing the capability of data technology implementation and analytics business cases in the banking industry to create business value. The challenges to building capabilities as a basis for data-driven business are data characteristics, data processing, data accessibility, data literacy, and data technology. The challenge is determining how to improve data accessibility and data literacy. When the capability has been built, generating value can be done on top of that, namely by increasing revenue, reducing costs, and lowering risk. To do this, it is necessary to run business use case analytics whose results can be measured, which focus on personalization and recommendations, optimizing processes with automation and integration, and optimizing credit risk. The results of the literature review are described in a conceptual model of capability development to generate value, which is the basis for developing a business strategy that can increase business value. Customer-centric analytics should be implemented by embedding an analytics engine in bank applications such as mobile banking, internet banking, or customer relationship management (CRM) applications that will improve the user experience such as personalization and recommendation as the keys to improving customer solutions. The impact is to increase customer attachment to a bank's applications and products because customers not only carry out daily banking activities but also have embedded insights that help them in their decision-making. By implementing Explore Understand Action Engage (EUAE) for customer journey, customer-centric analytics provide customers with a comprehensive view of their bank account activity and control over their money management, improve customer engagement by providing insights and recommendation. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

Hand Gesture Recognition Using FMCW Radar and Deep Learning for Understanding Deaf Sign Language,"[{""Penulis"":""Wibisono, Bagas""},{""Penulis"":""Suratman, Fiky Y.""},{""Penulis"":""Istiqomah""}]","People have difficulty in understanding sign language of deaf people therefore a technology is needed to translate sign language to help deaf people. In Indonesia, society lacks fluency in national sign languages like Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI), which can affect their self-confidence and social interaction skills with others. Previous studies generally used a camera in dataset retrieval in sign language recognition. There is a weakness in using the camera because it has to pay attention to environmental conditions, such as being influenced by light intensity. Radar can correct this deficiency because it uses electromagnetic waves. In this study proposed, the use of uRAD radar by Antheral based on radar Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) to detect and then collect words of SIBI for raw data that is IQ signals. The proposed technique applies the preprocessing methods for the frequency-domain IQ signals of radar echoes as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN). The system designed is able to classify five words of Indonesian Sign Language into five classes. Thereafter compare three self-constructed architectures to find the best model with differences in the number of convolution and pooling layers in each architecture. The results of the proposed architectural classification show the movement classification accuracy exceeds more than 98%. This study has high accuracy because of the proposed preprocessing method and compares several CNN architectures whose accuracy is higher than previous studies which also used radar. Based on the results, the proposed system can be helpful in understanding deaf sign language with SIBI. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Improvement of Assembly Manufacturing Process through Value Stream Mapping and Ranked Positional Weight: An Empirical Evidence from the Defense Industry,"[{""Penulis"":""Achmadi, Fandi""},{""Penulis"":""Harsanto, Budi""},{""Penulis"":""Yunani, Akhmad""}]","This study aims to improve the assembly manufacturing process to solve the workload imbalances by combining value stream mapping (VSM) and ranked positional weight (RPW). An empirical study was conducted in a defense manufacturing firm located in Indonesia. The study specifically focused on 155 components and 56 tasks distributed among 43 assembly workstations in one weapon product. The results of the analysis showed a significant reduction in the total cycle time, from 5121 s (85.35 min) to 3620 s (60.33 min), or a decrease of 29%. Additionally, the study found improvements in the balance of the assembly line as measured by balance delay, line efficiency, and smoothness index performance indicators. The application of VSM and RPW in this study is unique in the context of the defense industry, as it provides empirical analysis on cycle time and assembly line balance, which is rarely studied. The results of this study contribute to the advancement of literature in the field and provide valuable insights for other organizations in the defense industry and other manufacturing industries. By improving the efficiency and balance of the weapon assembly line, this study has the potential to increase productivity and reduce waste. © 2023 by the authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

This study investigates the influence of fiscal decentralisation and human development on regional economic growth. The sample data comprised 484 county-level in Indonesia and utilised the panel data method. The findings showed that the central government grant, locally generated revenue, and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth, although the degree of decentralisation negatively affected regional growth. Meanwhile, for regions with independence above 50 per cent, decentralisation, locally generated revenue, central government transfer and provincial loans and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth. In addition, findings also indicated that a dynamic effect exists, implying that the performance of previous regional economic growth influenced current economic achievements. The policy implication of the study is that policymakers cannot equalise policy to boost regional economic growth because every county has its specific characteristics. © 2023 The Author(s).

Distance learning offers a solution to overcome distance and time differences through the use of new information technology that can be continuously updated. However, distance learning also presents challenges and problems in engaging learners. It is important to know how the level of learner's engagement are during distance learning. To determine the engagement level of learners in distance learning, a detector is needed that can reach learners who are not visible to the instructor. Along with detection, interventions to improve engagement in distance learning are also necessary to maintain high levels of learner engagement. Previous studies on the detection of engagement with computer vision based on facial emotion expressions have not implemented interventions in their research.

The Effects of Daubechies Wavelet Basis Function (DWBF) and Decomposition Level on the Performance of Artificial Intelligence-Based Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Detection Based on Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals,"[{""Penulis"":""Mandala, Satria""},{""Penulis"":""Pratiwi Wibowo, Annisa Rizki""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""},{""Penulis"":""Suyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Zahid, Mohd Soperi Mohd""},{""Penulis"":""Rizal, Ardian""}]","Featured Application: A potential application developed from the results obtained by this study is a monitoring system of atrial fibrillation for stroke early warning in both healthy people and heart disease patients. This research studies the effects of both Daubechies wavelet basis function (DWBF) and decomposition level (DL) on the performance of detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) based on electrocardiograms (ECGs). ECG signals (consisting of 23 AF data and 18 normal data from MIT-BIH) were decomposed at various levels using several types of DWBF to obtain four wavelet coefficient features (WCFs), namely, minimum (min), maximum (max), mean, and standard deviation (stdev). These features were then classified to detect the presence of AF using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Distribution of training and testing data for the SVM uses the 5-fold cross-validation (CV) principle to produce optimum detection performance. In this study, AF detection performance is measured and analyzed based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The results of the analysis show that accuracy tends to decrease with increases in the decomposition level. In addition, it becomes stable in various types of DWBF. For both sensitivity and specificity, the results of the analysis show that increasing the decomposition level also causes a decrease in both sensitivity and specificity. However, unlike the accuracy, changing the DWBF type causes both two metrics to fluctuate over a wider range. The statistical results also indicate that the highest AF accuracy detection (i.e., 94.17%) is obtained at the Daubechies 2 (DB2) function with a decomposition level of 4, whereas the highest sensitivity, 97.57%, occurs when the AF detection uses DB6 with a decomposition level of 2. Finally, DB2 with decomposition level 4 results in 96.750% for specificity. The finding of this study is that selecting the appropriate DL has a more significant effect than DWBF on AF detection using WCF. © 2023 by the authors.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
The impact of large-scale social restriction and odd-even policies on transportation mobility and COVID-19 positivity rates in Jakarta,"[{""Penulis"":""Novriansyah, Muhamad Fahriza""},{""Penulis"":""Nugraha, Yudhistira""},{""Penulis"":""Wiguna, Hansen""},{""Penulis"":""Ernesto, Andy""},{""Penulis"":""Sulasikin, Andi""},{""Penulis"":""Nasution, Bahrul Ilmi""},{""Penulis"":""Kanggrawan, Juan Intan""},{""Penulis"":""Suherman, Alex L.""}]","SARS-Cov-2 spreads quickly and continues to do so to this day. One way to limit the spread is by limiting people's mobility through transportation. The Provincial Government of Jakarta has implemented the Large-Scale Social Restriction Transitional Phase-1 since June 5th, 2020, to limit people mobility and the odd-even policies August 3rd, 2020, to limit private vehicles. To assess the effectiveness of these policies against the positivity rate of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta, we used data exploration and significant tests (pre-and post-condition). The result shows that the odd-even policy significantly impacts private transportation mobility, mobility in public transportation, and the COVID-19 positivity rate in Jakarta. The relationship between those three parameters is linearly significant. The odd-even policy stimulates people to switch from private to public transportations and increases the positivity rate of COVID-19. The odd-even policy effectively reduces the mobility of private transportation but insignificantly reduces the positivity rate of COVID-19 in Jakarta. The results can be used as insights for policy decision-makers to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.  © 2023 Author(s).","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Heterogeneous Traffic Condition Dataset Collection for Creating Road Capacity Value,"[{""Penulis"":""Nasution, Surya Michrandi""},{""Penulis"":""Husni, Emir""},{""Penulis"":""Kuspriyanto, Kuspriyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Yusuf, Rahadian""}]","Indonesia has the third highest number of motorcycles, which means the traffic flow in Indonesia is heterogeneous. Traffic flow can specify its condition, whether it is a free flow or very heavy traffic. Traffic condition is the most important criterion used to find the best route from an origin to a destination. This paper collects the traffic condition for several road segments which are calculated based on the degree of saturation by using two methods, namely, (1) by counting the number of vehicles using object detection in the public closed-circuit television (CCTV) stream, and (2) by requesting the traffic information (vehicle’s speed) using TomTom. Both methods deliver the saturation degree and calculate the traffic condition for each road segment. Based on the experiments, the average error rate obtained by counting the number of vehicles on Pramuka–Cihapit and Trunojoyo was 0–2 cars, 2–3 motorcycles, and 0–1 for others. Meanwhile, the average error on Merdeka-Aceh Intersection reached 6 cars, 11 motorcycles, and 1 for other vehicles. The average speed calculation for the left side of the road is more accurate than the right side, and the average speed on the left side is less than 3.3 km/h. Meanwhile, on the right side, the differences between actual and calculated vehicle speeds are between 11.088 and 22.222 km/h. This high error rate is caused by (1) the low resolution of the public CCTV, (2) some obstacles interfering with the view of CCTV, (3) the misdetection of the type of vehicles, and by (4) the vehicles moving too fast. The collected dataset can be used in further studies to solve the congestion problem, especially in Indonesia. © 2023 by the authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Design/methodology/approach: The study population was all members of “Sharia Property Developer” (DPS) across Indonesia with criteria of having subordinates at least one person and is listed as a DPS member. The samples used were 71 people from the 200 members of DPS across Indonesia. The sampling method used was based on R2 value and significance level with an 80% statistical strength. Data analysis was carried out using smartPLS software to test the relationship of change management, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and leadership style on employee performance. Findings: The utilization of SEM in Smart PLS for change management with the ADKAR method had a negative value of 6.2% in affecting employee performance and 4.6% in affecting job satisfaction. Job satisfaction insignificantly affected employee performance by 7.5%. Leadership style and organizational commitment positively affected performance by 57.9% and 25.6%, respectively. Research limitations/implications: This study did not limit respondents’ education levels. Twenty percent of respondents were middle and high school graduates. Respondent’s position was mostly the highest leader in the company by 58%. Indicators in the ADKAR model did not implement the construct validity test since the researchers did not find precedent studies that discuss the indicators of the ADKAR model in detail. Practical implications: Factors that positively and significantly affected employee performance can be used to plan employee performance of DPS member companies.

Using all available technology for disaster mitigation is critical for pandemic prevention and control. Recent studies have uncovered the advantage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drones, particularly those with rotary wings, in dealing with the pandemic. Much effort has been devoted to developing a rotary-wing drone system as a flying platform for aerial monitoring. However, several factors must be considered when visually observing a specific region, i.e., the area's size, topographic contours, locations of special interest inside the area, approach points to the area, and the observation timeframe. Since fever is a common symptom of COVID-19, human body temperature monitoring is highlighted for fever screening, with the objective of minimizing people with high body temperatures going to the crowd. A major challenge is creating a system that can provide accurate body temperature data, which is critical for fighting the pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to present a rotary wing drone application for aerial human body temperature measurements. The paper also proposed an alternative solution based on using a portable, low-cost, Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR) thermal imaging camera. The FLIR thermal camera is incorporated into the drone's electronic system. Furthermore, thermal image data are transmitted into the ground station via a radio telemetry transceiver to allow flexible surveillance by the operator. Indoor and outdoor experiments reveal that the system has been effectively installed and provide data collection for further research.

As a result, patients' rehabilitation and treatment typically take a long time and involve ongoing medication, physical activity, and rehabilitation training. However, this rehabilitation process is still done manually in most rehab centers worldwide. Since the impact of computer vision on this profession, machine learning and deep learning have been introduced to the medical industry to improve rehabilitation using the new technology. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been proven in countless studies to be precise at classifying performance in various fields, including visual field, computer vision, audio, and text defects. This study analyzed the classification accuracy of different pre-trained models (Designed network, VGG-Net, AlexNet, and Inception). We created a thorough comparative analysis to compare the accuracy of several CNN models. The image-profiled sound uses the Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) to produce the best results and accuracy.

To investigate the impact of the technology with smart mechanisms on student learning achievements (i.e., geometry ability (GA) and problem-solving skill (PSS), we conducted a quasi-experiment with the participation of fifth-grade students (n = 52). They were divided into two groups (i.e., experimental and control group) and carried out two stages of learning activity with an independent experiment which is underpinned by a set of problem-solving activities. Stage 1 aimed to investigate the impact of personalization and contextualization mechanisms, while stage 2 focuses on assessing socialization's impact on geometry learning. The results showed that the experimental group students achieve good performance in geometry measurement and problem-solving compared to those in the control group.

However, women continue encountering numerous difficulties when engaging in entrepreneurial activities, particularly from a societal perspective. Therefore, it is necessary to study the underlying factors influencing women's entrepreneurial intentions that lead to their success in entrepreneurship. This study examines gender stereotype perceptions, perceived social support and self-efficacy in women's entrepreneurial intentions in Batik micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in West Java, Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative method by randomly distributing questionnaires to women entrepreneurs in the MSME sector in the batik craft industry in the Trusmi area, West Java, Indonesia. The research questionnaire was completed by 150 female entrepreneurs, and a structural equation model-partial least squares (PLS) was employed to examine the hypotheses proposed in this study. Findings: The findings of this study revealed that gender stereotype perception and perceived social support have a positive and significant effect on self-efficacy. Gender stereotype perceptions affect women's entrepreneurial intentions, both directly and mediated by self-efficacy. Meanwhile, perceived social support has a significant effect on women's entrepreneurial intention only when it is mediated by self-efficacy. Originality/value: This study presents empirical evidence on how gender stereotype perception, perceived social support and self-efficacy affect women's entrepreneurial intentions and establishes a novel conceptual framework for women's entrepreneurship in emerging economies. This study provides academic and practical implications by identifying the entrepreneurial intentions of women who have carried out entrepreneurial activities. This study also provides direction for policymakers to encourage women's entrepreneurial intentions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Online learning has many limitations compared to offline one. However, it must keep running because one of the strategies against the SAR-Cov2 virus is to inhibit its spread by limiting direct contact with other people. The literature review is carried out with a protocol involving text mining tools to find the most widely used keywords and their relationships, which is then carried out by a snowball literature review to deepen these keywords. There are several findings from this study, namely (1) Three critical components that play a significant role in improving learning outcomes in the distance learning method, namely the role of students, lectures, and technology. (2) A framework must ensure that the other three components perform their functions properly and provide an effective learning environment. (3) Reward and punishment play a vital role in ensuring the framework is implemented as it should be. Integrating an effective learning environment with remuneration programs and teaching grants will encourage improvements in the learning process and increase the number of positive contents on the Internet.

CSR needs to be understood based on a priority scale and objectives to build a solid organizational structure and ensure sustainable CSR implementation. In this regard, CSR implementation at the micro and macro levels needs further explanation. The study aims to analyze the effect of CSR on employee performance through assessment and job satisfaction using the micro foundation framework. This causal study surveyed 382 state-owned enterprises’ non-manager employees in Indonesia. The results demonstrate employees’ responses to internal and external CSR. Internal CSR, which primarily aims to improve employee performance, was found to improve employee satisfaction and engagement and lead to better performance more significantly than external CSR. Internal CSR had a higher effect on employee performance than external CSR. Compiling a scale of top priorities for corporate stakeholders became the leading choice to encourage long-term performance. The originality of this study is that the foundation of long-term performance ensures the corporation’s performance, and CSR lies in the strength of the microstructure at the individual level. The implementation of CSR based on the legal system requires paying attention to the scale of priorities based on the internal function of CSR in strengthening a corporation’s microstructure. © 2023 by the authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
The tremendous household debt in Asia Pacific countries: is it determined by financial development?,"[{""Penulis"":""Kusairi, Suhal""},{""Penulis"":""Sanusi, Nur Azura""},{""Penulis"":""Muktiyanto, Ali""}]","Since the early twentieth century, the tremendous increase in household debt has motivated researchers to find the determinant factors of this phenomenon. The paper uses data from Asia Pacific countries and dynamic heterogeneous panel method analysis to determine factors of household debt. The results find that financial development and financial institution access have a long-run positive relationship, stable and convergent with household debt. This implies that as the financial system developed, as evidenced by easy access to financial institutions, it provided some attractive financial instruments and financial markets became liquid. As a result, household debt increased due to easier access to financing and credit options that matched people's needs. However, in the short run, financial development and financial institution access do not strongly affect household debt of countries overall. Also, the real interest rate and housing price have a positive impact, and stock capital accumulation and household consumption harm household debt in the long run. Therefore, supervision of the volatility of household debt and financial development are important for sustainable economic growth.

Mutation detection can be performed using alignment and machine learning techniques. However, alignment techniques require reference sequences, and machine learning techniques still cannot predict index mutation and require supporting tools. Therefore, in this research, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model was proposed to detect the type and index mutation faster and without reference sequences and supporting tools. The architecture of the proposed TCN model is specifically designed for sequential labeling tasks on DNA sequence data. This allows for the detection of the mutation type of each nucleotide in the sequence, and if the nucleotide has a mutation, the index mutation can be obtained. The proposed model also uses 2-mers and 3-mers mapping techniques to improve detection performance. Based on the tests that have been carried out, the proposed TCN model can achieve the highest F1-score of 0.9443 for COSMIC dataset and 0.9629 for RSCM dataset, Additionally, the proposed TCN model can detect index mutation six times faster than BiLSTM model. Furthermore, the proposed model can detect type and index mutations based on the patient's DNA sequence, without the need for reference sequences or other additional tools.  © 2023 Wisesty et al.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

A person can be known to have pneumonia or not by having a chest x-ray examination, meanwhile, it is difficult to identify the cause of pneumonia by just looking at the x-ray image results. This research was conducted to obtain a system that can classify the causes of pneumonia. This research can be used as a reference for development in further research. The classification system designed in this research was by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method with ResNet-50 architecture. By using the proposed method, an analysis was carried out to obtain the best parameters for the system. CNN can imitate the image recognition system in the human visual cortex. By implementing a skip connection system, ResNet-50 is used to overcome the problem of declining system performance due to a high-depth architecture. The dataset used are secondary dataset x-ray images of the lungs, consisting of three classes, namely: bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal. This research produces the best accuracy of 88.88% and a loss of 0.4597. The precision, recall, and F1-Score parameters get a value of 83.34, 83.33, and 83.16%. The result shows that the pneumonia classification system designed using the CNN architecture ResNet-50 method is able to classify x-ray images of the lungs according to their respective classes.

Building a telecommunications network that optimally connects Indonesia's islands is essential. Currently, telecommunications networks in Indonesia are connected using the Palapa Ring Indonesia network. Several adjacent islands must specify the closest point to choose a neighbouring route. This paper uses a travelling salesman problem (TSP) that uses the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms to determine the shortest route and optimal computation time. Paper modification has several parameters: number of iterations, neuron size, and space. The measurement results show that SOM is better at measuring the shortest route length and computational time than ACO.

The effects of wage spillover from foreign firms on total factor productivity: do job characteristics matter?,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramdhan, Dadang""}]","This study investigates whether an increase in wages of foreign firms generates the total factor of productivity (TFP) growth of Indonesian manufacturing firms by considering different job characteristics and geographical boundaries. Using system GMM, the result shows that on average the wage spillover in production jobs within an industry positively affects the TFP, while the wage spillover in non-production jobs contributes negatively. Moreover, the wage spillover in production jobs and non-production jobs within a province do not affect the TFP of Indonesian manufacturing firms. These results indicate that employees in production jobs have larger contributions to increasing TFP than those in non-production jobs when foreign firms increase their wages.

Thus, the number of users in any given area is bound to rise with technological advancements. However, internet connec-tivity has become challenging in Indonesia, particularly in the dense urban area of Central Jakarta, due to network congestion caused by the region’s enormous population of users and limited existing frequency. Therefore, this research aims to utilize the 2100 MHz frequency band as an additional frequency for the 4G LTE-A network in the dense urban Central Jakarta region. Furthermore, this research employs a techno-economic assessment of the deployment of 4G LTE-A with and without carrier aggregation (CA). The purpose is to see if expanding the 4G LTE-A network in the study area by adding the 2100 MHz frequency and utilizing the CA method is feasible and beneficial. According to the results, using the CA technique leads to fewer eNodeB requirements in the dense urban area of Central Jakarta than without the CA technique. Furthermore, through network simulation soft-ware, Forsk Atoll, good quality of the Key Performance Indi-cators (KPI) is obtained. In addition, based on the business perspective, this research acquired good Net Present Value (NPV), and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) values are ob-tained, with returns on capital in the range of two to three years.

Enabling EV Roaming Through Cascading WebSockets in OCPP 1.6,"[{""Penulis"":""Priyasta, Dwidharma""},{""Penulis"":""Hadiyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Septiawan, Reza""}]","Currently, there are four major protocols for EV roaming that support electric vehicle drivers to access charge points from different networks with a single user registration through roaming agreements between charge point operators (CPOs) and mobility service providers (MSPs): the Open Clearing House Protocol (OCHP), the Open InterCharge Protocol (OICP), the eMobility Inter-operation Protocol (eMIP), and the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI). These protocols facilitate data exchange between CPOs and MSPs using a roaming hub or peer-to-peer connections. On the other hand, the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) is the standard protocol widely used for communication between the charge point and the central system within the CPO’s internal system. OCPP has been integrated into many charge point products today, where OCPP 1.6 supports Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format over the WebSocket, with the charge point acting as the WebSocket client and the central system as the WebSocket server. The aim of this study is to further enhance the functionality of OCPP by integrating the role of the WebSocket client into the central system to support EV roaming for EV drivers. This new approach describes the architecture that includes the actors and their roles, which are the Charge Point that delivers energy to electric vehicles, the Central System that manages the Charge Point and requests for EV roaming, and the National Access Point that acts as a roaming hub in the proposed EV roaming system. Additionally, three simulation models have been created, each representing an actor and their role in the proposed system. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed EV roaming system are evaluated through experiments during high traffic load conditions of a network using the simulation models and actual charge point products. The experiment scenarios specifically focus on cases related to user authorization and billing. This study only concern on the time consumption for user authorization. The results confirm that the proposed EV roaming system can be implemented based on the enhanced functionality of the OCPP, with the average time for user authorization over five attempts range between 3 ms for the simplest scenario one to 2200 ms for the most complex scenario four, which can be considered quite impressive. © 2023 Lavoisier.

"The nexus between households’ indebtedness and consumption: the role of gender, geographical area and income groups","[{""Penulis"":""Wong, Zun Yuan""},{""Penulis"":""Kusairi, Suhal""},{""Penulis"":""Abdul Halim, Zairihan""}]","Purpose: The persistent increase in household indebtedness is an alarming issue that is becoming a major concern for economists and governments in developing nations. Although household consumption is an essential source of economic growth, households’ failure to meet their financial obligations will be one of the causes of economic problems if the increase in consumption is largely financed by household borrowing. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the nexus between households’ indebtedness and consumption and the roles of household characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a microdata set of the Household Expenditure and Income Survey in 2019, which contained a simple random sampling of 4,730 households. Findings: Using a simultaneous equations model, our results show a negative nexus between households’ consumption and their indebtedness. We find that household savings and size have an indirect impact on the debt service ratio, while the assets and total debt repayment instalments indirectly influence household consumption. We also identify differences in the relationship between the gender of the household head, rural and urban locations and income groups in consumption and indebtedness. Research limitations/implications: The implication of this study is that governments should adopt several programmes to increase the awareness of household financial and debt management, especially for those in the low-income group. Originality/value: This study contributes to the empirical literature by establishing a microeconomic perspective of consumption and an indebtedness model focusing on the differences in household characteristics in explaining consumption and indebtedness. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The populist economic paradigm, known as “Koperasi” in Indonesia, has long existed. Nonetheless, Koperasi was unable to keep up with information and technology in the 4.0 industrial era. When other industrial models use information technology on a large scale, Koperasi appears to have difficulty abandoning the conventional paradigm. Slowly but surely, Koperasi is losing popularity, particularly among Generation Z, who considers digital technology an integral part of their daily lives. The breadth of Koperasi's business contracts and becomes constrained, as does the company's cash. In contrast, information technology offers chances to small and medium-sized businesses. The data indicates that this sector generates 60.5% of the national GDP, employs 96.9% of the entire labor force, and accounts for 99.9% of total employment. Unfortunately, a large number of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSME) have limited money, and therefore tend to favor fintech services that provide quick accessibility over Koperasi. This article aims to offer an E-Koperasi model platform and the synergy between Koperasi and MSMEs, specifically the digital marketplace platform. The platform requirements are designed using the Software Requirements Specification and User Acceptance Test. As a result, an application is created to serve as a model platform for Koperasi and MSMEs. It is proposed that the platform will support the government's effort to digitalize Koperasi and MSMEs, as well as boost their Industrial 4.0 competitiveness. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Integrated Solid Waste Management System Using Distributed System Architecture for Indonesia: An IT Blueprint,"[{""Penulis"":""Suryodiningrat, Satrio Pradono""},{""Penulis"":""Ramadhan, Arief""}]","Indonesia is in the top 5 country that generates solid waste. It is the 14th largest country in the world in managing waste, but unfortunately, Indonesia is not known for its diligence to waste management. In 2019, the coordinating minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment of the Republic of Indonesia, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, stated that it is a top priority in the national agenda to keep improving solid waste management due to the growing number of people living in the urban areas and the estimated 105.000 tons of solid waste a day. This paper aims to create an IT blueprint for this waste management through a distributed system that allows an optimum flow of waste out of dense urban centers and into the proper waste disposal facilities. It involves smarter waste surveillance, a consolidated fleet of collection agents of varying mobility and capacity and includes people participation to control unnecessary waste generation. The system should be scalable while using existing resources and systems to manage the problem in the long term. It should maintain the three principles of Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM): waste prevention, recycling, and disposal. New technologies, such as a sensor network to monitor waste generation close to the source, can help burgeon localized SWM techniques such as community composting. The country can take the steps necessary to mitigate the problem. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Learning management system (LMS) is a learning media that is widely used in educational institutions. However, not all educational institutions have sufficient resources to build an LMS from scratch. “Angkasa LMS” Web is a Web that allows educational institutions to order a ready-to-use LMS easily. The target users of this service are pretty varied because they consist of education management and educational management foundations, especially in areas of Indonesia that have Internet access. To be used easily by these varied target users, this Website must have good usability in its user interface. For this reason, usability testing needs to be carried out in order to get feedback for improving the user interface design before the application is delivered to the public. However, the developer has obstacles related to the COVID-19 pandemic policy to carry out usability testing, which limits direct interaction with people. Moreover, the project time is quite narrow, and the schedule is quite tight for the developer team. Based on these limitations, this study conducted usability testing of the “Angkasa LMS” Web case study using the unmoderated remote usability testing method. The experimental results show that this method can be used to obtain insightful feedback from the participants, with additional treatment such as the use of convenience sampling, periodic reminders for participants, and the increasing number of participants exceeding the target. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Two extreme precipitation (EP) events led to major flooding on 23–25 March 2021 and produced a rain-hail mixture (RHM) on 11 April 2021 in the Greater Bandung (GB) basin area, Indonesia. We investigated the spatial and vertical structure of precipitating cloud systems and the plausible mechanism triggering the two case studies with combined multiple remote sensing observations using an X-band polarimetric Doppler Weather Radar (Xpol) and X-band rain scanner radar (RSR) network, supported by rain gauges and satellite observation. The local processes controlling the intense rainfall events over the complex topography were quantified for the first time using an observational campaign in Indonesia. During the first EP event (23–25 March 2021), the modified satellite algorithm successively confirmed that the mesoscale convective system triggered the local anomalous circulation. The RSR network reveals that the EP in eastern GB contributed to the overflow of the Citarum River alongside the basin, coinciding with the eastward propagating convective system that produced oblate-shaped water droplets without hail. Nevertheless, during the second EP event on 11 April 2021, the strengthening of mountain-based convection played a main role in producing RHM, confirmed by a hail differential reflectivity larger than 12 dB and exhibited hail early stage over two height levels in different locations (981 m and 1033 m) in the GB. Our study also found Doppler vorticity-based and rain sizes combination indicators using RSR data networks in capturing such extreme weather events over complex topography with 35 min early times to support the early warning system of hydrometeorological disaster mitigation over GB, Indonesia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Several factors that support the growth of nursery plants are nutritional factors, sunlight, temperature, soil pH, water, and soil moisture. In terms of effectiveness and ease of access to information in monitoring the supporting condition factors and facilitating the farmers, an Android-based monitoring system was built to monitor the growth of nursery plants. The system consists of several sensors, such as a soil pH sensor, UV light sensor, and soil moisture sensor embedded with Raspberry pi and firebase. The proposed system was examined on a plantation area of 900 square meters. The testing is conducted by placing a combination of 4 to 8 sensors in the plantation area. Data from each sensor is processed by calculating the average, and the results are rounded to the nearest value. The test stated that to monitor an area of 900 square meters, the area with five sensors implanted can be used as the optimal implementation. Apart from economic reasons, the minor rounding error equals 8.25% compared to the number of other sensors. The results that are informed to the farmers are also within the appropriate range.

Implementation of augmented reality as information technology in judicial system toward society 5.0 in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Zen, Adrian Permana""},{""Penulis"":""Miraj, Isroni Muhammad""},{""Penulis"":""Nugroho, Avianto""},{""Penulis"":""Trihanondo D.""},{""Penulis"":""Wiguna I.P.""}]","Science in the application of information technology into life in Indonesia has a strong potential to support the movement towards society 5.0 where humans apply the development of information technology in the form of Augmented Reality (AR) in everyday life. In Indonesia, the application of information technology has not been carried out because the technology is not yet mature and there is no preparation to face the all-digital era. COVID-19 encourages and forces the public to implement the development of remote information technology in terms of education or social interaction due to concerns about the spread of the virus. The judiciary system is one aspect that needs to be considered because trial proceedings in a courtroom could sometimes prove to be challenging to perform effectively, especially in terms of a witness testifying, demonstrating all detailed aspects of the crime scene from lawyers, and validating all the necessary evidence. This review discusses the potential to apply information technology using AR into the judiciary system to support society 5.0 in.Indonesia. Due to the lack of a robust, sophisticated, integrated system of information technology as well as skepticism persistent within both justice enforcers and Indonesian society regarding E-Court System, Implementation of AR in Indonesia could not be carried out within a short period of time. Unless, the government ensures and provide the readiness of all the relevant digital & information technology to provide an effective access to the implementation of AR technology in its judiciary system combined with a strong and massive socialization from authorized government officials along with other relevant social elements which is excersiced gradually and systematically in public. © 2023 Author(s).","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Artificial intelligence based modelling and hybrid optimization of linseed oil biodiesel with graphene nanoparticles to stringent biomedical safety and environmental standards,"[{""Penulis"":""Rao, Papabathina Mastan""},{""Penulis"":""Dhoria, Sneha Haresh""},{""Penulis"":""Patro, S Gopal Krishna""},{""Penulis"":""Gopidesi, Radha Krishna""},{""Penulis"":""Alkahtani, Meshel Q.""},{""Penulis"":""Islam, Saiful""},{""Penulis"":""Vijaya, Murkonda""},{""Penulis"":""Jayanthi, Juturi Lakshmi""},{""Penulis"":""Khan, Mohammad Amir""},{""Penulis"":""Razak, Abdul""},{""Penulis"":""Kumar, Raman""},{""Penulis"":""Rizal, Achmad""},{""Penulis"":""Ammarullah, Muhammad Imam""}]","In this work, experiments were carried out in line with Design of Experiments (DOE) standards to assess the performance and emission features of 5% graphene nanoparticles added linseed biodiesel. The engine was operated with the blends of B10, B20, and B30 with 5% graphene nano additives (designated as B10G5, B20G5, and B30G5). To find the parameter's optimum values, the Desirability Function approach (DFA), Swarm Salp single objective, Multi Objective Bat algorithm (MOBA), Response surface methodology (RSM) and D-optimal design approach were employed. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to anticipate these characteristics. It was found that B20G5 had a better brake thermal efficiency (BTE), when compared to the other samples (and around 11% higher than diesel fuel at full load). The emissions of Carbon monoxide (CO) and Hydrocarbon (HC) were lower for B20G5 blended fuel than for diesel (Around 23.52% lower than diesel). In comparison to Response surface methodology (RSM), the overall coefficient of determination (R2) value using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for was high. As a result, it was revealed that the ANN was typically better than the RSM in forecasting the various factors affecting the engine performance. The optimum outcomes were achieved by single objective (Salp Swarm algorithm) and multi-objective algorithms. According to multi-objective algorithm, a B20G5 nano additive biodiesel mix at its maximum Brake power (BP) produced the highest value of BTE with the lowest Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions. The comparison shows that B20G5 can be used easily without making any modifications to engines. © 2023 The Authors","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Optimal detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia using deep transfer learning model,"[{""Penulis"":""Fata, Rana Adinda Manalus""},{""Penulis"":""Irawati, Indrarini Dyah""},{""Penulis"":""Hadiyoso, Sugondo""}]","Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a rapidly progressing malignancy originating from hematopoietic cells, necessitates prompt and precise diagnosis due to its potential lethality within a short span of months. Technological advancements are therefore pivotal in aiding medical practitioners to reduce the probability of human error, expedite diagnosis and subsequently, improve patient outcomes. This study presents a novel system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), capable of diagnosing ALL through image analysis of affected cells. Our proposed system employs two well-established CNN architectures, VGG16 and ResNet50, coupled with two optimization algorithms, Adam and RMSprop, to classify image data into two distinct categories. The utilized dataset, C-NMC Leukemia 2019, was subjected to a variety of test scenarios involving differing epoch variations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100) and a consistent learning rate of 0.0001. The results suggest that the proposed system exhibits superior performance when utilizing the VGG16 architecture in conjunction with the Adam optimizer, achieving a training accuracy of 93.80% and a testing accuracy of 87.00%.

The drivers of E-learning satisfaction during the early COVID-19 pandemic: empirical evidence from an indonesian private university,"[{""Penulis"":""Pangarso, Astadi""},{""Penulis"":""Setyorini, Retno""}]","The end of the COVID-19 pandemic that directly impacts students’ learning cannot be predicted with certainty. Previously dominated by face-to-face learning methods, student learning has fully transitioned into full e-learning, or online/distance learning provides a completely new experience for students. Students are important learning recipients and university stakeholders. Therefore, much attention should be paid to their learning satisfaction to ensure that higher education’s learning process is conducted well during a pandemic. The absence of quantitative empirical research on the drivers of e-learning satisfaction in the setting of private higher education is the theoretical impetus for this study. This study evaluated a learning satisfaction model during (early) the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire survey with a sample of 722 undergraduate students from a top-ranking private university was conducted in Indonesia, which reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia in 2020. Survey results identify the social presence, confirmation, and student-student interaction as the drivers of e-learning satisfaction during the pandemic. Moreover, robust learning system quality has a significant indirect influence on learning satisfaction that is mediated by student-student interaction. The findings of this study can provide implications for private university administrators in Indonesia to pay attention to and make improvements related to social presence, confirmation, learning system quality, and student-student interaction during a pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s).

Investigating information and communication technology-enabled national development as a multi-level social process,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramadani, Luthfi""},{""Penulis"":""Breidbach, Christoph F.""},{""Penulis"":""Kurnia, Sherah""}]","Are centralised or decentralised strategies more suitable to address a developing nation's socio-economic challenges through information and communication technology (ICT)? We respond to this long-standing question by conceptualising ICT-enabled national development as a multi-level social process and by drawing on empirical findings from a natural experiment set in the context of health information system projects in Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that successful ICT-enabled national development is not contingent on pursuing one strategy or the other but on how micro-level actors interpret, and subsequently respond to, these strategies and the local changes they trigger. Our findings indicate that centralisation and decentralisation are complementary rather than competing strategies to ICT-enabled national development because, if integrated into a hybrid strategy, decentralisation enables local communities to achieve national development outcomes commonly attributed to centralisation. As such, our work provides empirical evidence, explanations and new theoretical insight into the wider ‘centralisation versus decentralisation’ debate, while also outlining avenues for future research and guidelines for policymakers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Development of Smart Air Purifier for Reducing Indoor Particulate Matter,"[{""Penulis"":""Rachmawati L.M.""},{""Penulis"":""Hasmul N.A.""},{""Penulis"":""Chandra I.""},{""Penulis"":""Salam R.A.""}]","Indoor air quality is crucial to observe because most people spend 90% of their time in the room. Indoor air quality is influenced by various parameters, especially PM 2,5, from a mixture of air outside and inside the room itself. If the occupants are exposed to this parameter continuously, it will affect the occupant's health significantly. Hence, it is necessary to control indoor air quality if this parameter exceeds the specified quality standards. One technology to reduce PM 2,5 is an air purifier. Air purifiers are generally composed of an exhaust fan, HEPA filter, and pre-filter. One of the air purifiers' evolution is the smart-air-purifier. Smart-air-purifier can automatically adjust the speeds of the fan so as can minimizes electricity costs. The designed smart system can classify PM 2,5 concentration based on fuzzy logic to flow rate settings using pulse width modulation (PWM). In addition, to analyze the performance of the smart air purifier, we test it in a chamber. The test results show the performance of the smart air purifier in reducing PM 2,5, the clean air delivery rate measurement of the smart air purifier, and its power consumption which can minimize 67.42% of electricity use than commercial air purifiers.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Continuing advances in echocardiography have extended imaging capabilities into the 3D domain, subsequently overcoming the geometric assumptions associated with conventional 2D acquisitions. Nevertheless, the analysis of 3D echocardiography (3DE) poses several challenges associated with limited spatial resolution, poor contrast-to-noise ratio, complex noise characteristics, and image anisotropy. To develop automated methods for 3DE analysis, a sufficiently large, labeled dataset is typically required. However, ground truth segmentations have historically been difficult to obtain due to the high inter-observer variability associated with manual analysis. We address this lack of expert consensus by registering labels derived from higher-resolution subject-specific cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, producing 536 annotated 3DE images from 143 human subjects (10 of which were excluded). This heterogeneous population consists of healthy controls and patients with cardiac disease, across a range of demographics. To demonstrate the utility of such a dataset, a state-of-the-art, self-configuring deep learning network for semantic segmentation was employed for automated 3DE analysis. Using the proposed dataset for training, the network produced measurement biases of −9 ± 16 ml, −1 ± 10 ml, −2 ± 5 %, and 5 ± 23 g, for end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, and mass, respectively, outperforming an expert human observer in terms of accuracy as well as scan-rescan reproducibility. As part of the Cardiac Atlas Project, we present here a large, publicly available 3DE dataset with ground truth labels that leverage the higher resolution and contrast of CMR, to provide a new benchmark for automated 3DE analysis. Such an approach not only reduces the effect of observer-specific bias present in manual 3DE annotations, but also enables the development of analysis techniques which exhibit better agreement with CMR compared to conventional methods. This represents an important step for enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic and prognostic information to be obtained from echocardiography.

Multi Modal Feature Extraction for Classification of Vascular Dementia in Post-Stroke Patients Based on EEG Signal,"[{""Penulis"":""36850499""},{""Penulis"":""""},{""Penulis"":""36850499""},{""Penulis"":""Hadiyoso, Sugondo""},{""Penulis"":""Zakaria, Hasballah""},{""Penulis"":""Anam Ong, Paulus""},{""Penulis"":""Erawati Rajab, Tati Latifah""}]","Dementia is a term that represents a set of symptoms that affect the ability of the brain’s cognitive functions related to memory, thinking, behavior, and language. At worst, dementia is often called a major neurocognitive disorder or senile disease. One of the most common types of dementia after Alzheimer’s is vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is closely related to cerebrovascular disease, one of which is stroke. Post-stroke patients with recurrent onset have the potential to develop dementia. An accurate diagnosis is needed for proper therapy management to ensure the patient’s quality of life and prevent it from worsening. The gold standard diagnostic of vascular dementia is complex, includes psychological tests, complete memory tests, and is evidenced by medical imaging of brain lesions. However, brain imaging methods such as CT-Scan, PET-Scan, and MRI have high costs and cannot be routinely used in a short period. For more than two decades, electroencephalogram signal analysis has been an alternative in assisting the diagnosis of brain diseases associated with cognitive decline. Traditional EEG analysis performs visual observations of signals, including rhythm, power, and spikes. Of course, it requires a clinician expert, time consumption, and high costs. Therefore, a quantitative EEG method for identifying vascular dementia in post-stroke patients is discussed in this study. This study used 19 EEG channels recorded from normal elderly, post-stroke with mild cognitive impairment, and post-stroke with dementia. The QEEG method used for feature extraction includes relative power, coherence, and signal complexity; the evaluation performance of normal-mild cognitive impairment-dementia classification was conducted using Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results of the classification simulation showed the highest accuracy of 96% by Gaussian SVM with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.6% and 97.9%, respectively.

"Examining prison entrepreneurship programs, self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience as drivers for prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions","[{""Penulis"":""Ciptono, Wakhid Slamet""},{""Penulis"":""Anggadwita, Grisna""},{""Penulis"":""Indarti, Nurul""}]","Purpose: Ex-prisoners often experience negative stigma from society, making it difficult to find employment upon release. Prison institutions play an active role in building character and improving prisoners' skills by providing various empowerment programs to increase opportunities for their economic potential. However, these programs are considered not optimal in increasing the entrepreneurial intentions of prisoners. This study aims to identify the effects of prison entrepreneurship programs, entrepreneurial resilience and self-efficacy as drivers in increasing prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions. This study also examines the effect of these variables focusing on prisoners with neither entrepreneurial experience nor entrepreneurial training. Design/methodology/approach: This study deployed a quantitative method by distributing a questionnaire to prisoners involved in talent and skill development activities (called BIMKER, an abbreviation in Indonesian, which means Work Guidance), a compulsory program provided by prison institutions. A total of 204 prisoners, including 70 with no entrepreneurial experience, completed the research questionnaire in one of the prison institutions in Indonesia. Partial least sequential-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as the analytical technique. Findings: The study findings show that the prison entrepreneurship program has not been able to influence prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions directly. However, the prison entrepreneurship program has a positive and significant effect on increasing prisoners' self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience that ultimately encourages the emergence of entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial resilience was found not to affect entrepreneurial intentions for prisoners with no entrepreneurial experience and who have never attended entrepreneurship training. Originality/value: This study identifies the drivers of prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions, including prison entrepreneurship programs, self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience. These can be used as references to build understanding at the theoretical level and can be adopted practically. This study expands the social cognitive theory (SCT) and entrepreneurial intention models (EIMs) by adding new insights into the context of prison entrepreneurship that underline the potential of prisoners engaging in entrepreneurship, once released, to expand opportunities, learning and employment.

The suggested prediction model was evaluated against a variety of machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree (DT), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The experimental findings demonstrated that the proposed DNN model outperformed all other models, with average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 17.295, 25.940, and 35.146 mg/dL over prediction horizons (PHs) of 15, 30, and 45 minutes, respectively. Additionally, we have included the suggested prediction model in web-based blood glucose level prediction tools. By using this web-based system, patients may readily acquire their future blood glucose levels, allowing for the generation of preventative alarms prior to crucial hypoglycemia or hyperglycemic situations © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Implementation of Random Forest Classifier for Real-time Earthquake Detection System,"[{""Penulis"":""Junior, Rio""},{""Penulis"":""Murti, Ary""},{""Penulis"":""Rahmawati, Dien""}]","An earthquake is one disaster that happened unpredictably and in some cases, it harms humanity. There are lots of research that studies earthquake vibrations using machine learning algorithms. However, implementing it in real-time application systems such as early warning systems is quite challenging due to the similarity of earthquake vibrations and non-earthquake vibrations (human activities and noises). Therefore, this study proposed an earthquake detection with Random Forest Classifier to distinguish earthquake and non-earthquake vibrations in a real-time application earthquake detection system. This study shows that Random Forest Classifier in a detection device is capable of classifying non-earthquake vibrations very well while it can classify earthquake vibrations with a success rate of 78.89%.  © 2023 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Cleaner production is a major factor to attain sustainability because it is part of the steps for sustainability process. Innovation is required in the adoption process of cleaner production to reach sustainability; not to mention it has a role in cleaner production activity. This research model consists of two second-order variables, i.e., open innovation climate, and open innovation. Based on hypothesis testing on modern SMEs, open innovation has a positive influence on cleaner production; and open innovation climate has a positive influence on open innovation modern SMEs; environmental dynamism and environmental competitiveness do not have a positive effect in moderating open innovation climate and open innovation. On the other hand, all hypotheses on traditional SMEs are confirmed to have a positive influence or/and positive effect; open innovation has a positive influence on cleaner production; open innovation climate also has a positive influence on open innovation; environmental dynamism and environmental competitiveness have positive effects in moderating open innovation climate and open innovation.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
The internationalization performance of Indonesian SMEs during COVID-19 pandemic: exploring a mediation model,"[{""Penulis"":""Anggadwita, Grisna""},{""Penulis"":""Indarti, Nurul""},{""Penulis"":""Sinha, Paresha""},{""Penulis"":""Manik, Hardo Firmana Given Grace""}]","Purpose: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in emerging economies face significant challenges in formulating effective strategies to enter international markets, particularly amid uncertain conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, there is a pressing need to examine the performance of these SMEs and evaluate their internationalization process. This study aims to examine the effects of international entrepreneurial orientation on the internationalization performance of SMEs and the mediating effects of organizational dynamic capability and organizational culture in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative method with a survey approach by distributing questionnaires to 206 SMEs in Indonesia that have implemented internationalization practices. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to predict and estimate relationships. Findings: This study finds that one of the SMEs’ strategies to encounter the new normal era of COVID-19 is to improve their internationalization performance, especially by actively participating in international markets. The empirical results show that organizational dynamic capabilities and organizational culture are proven to fully mediate the relationship between international entrepreneurial orientation and the internationalization performance of SMEs. Meanwhile, international entrepreneurial orientation does not directly affect SMEs’ internationalization performance. This study confirms the mediating role of organizational dynamic capabilities and organizational culture in dynamic capabilities theory and their relevance to internationalization. Originality/value: This study provides valuable insights and encourages owner-managers and policy-makers in emerging economies, particularly Indonesia, to develop organizational dynamic capabilities and organizational culture that align with the demands of internationalization. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The regulation also states several internal measures designed to restore the lake's water quality. Unfortunately, detailed information on pollution control priorities, the amount that must be controlled for water quality improvements to be visible, and the effectiveness of internal restoration efforts have yet to be obtained. This can hinder the lake restoration process and, furthermore, its sustainable management. This study aimed to develop a web-based numerical model as an open-source web-service for guiding restoration in Lake Batur. It is accessible via the interactive graphical user interface (GUI) running in a standard web browser and includes tools of varying complexity. The platform provides the user with features to set up some parameters, run and analyze the numerical water quality, and the possibility to set up, run and compare various lake management scenarios. The preliminary results show that the model was able to represent existing daily water quality dynamics.

Differences in Information Security Behavior of Smartphone Users in Indonesia Using Pearson’s Chi-square and Post Hoc Test,"[{""Penulis"":""Candiwan""},{""Penulis"":""Sudirman, Bella Pertiwi""},{""Penulis"":""Sari, Puspita Kencana""}]","The risk of data theft is still a negative impact of smartphone technology development that harms its users. One cause of data theft is information security behavior. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine information security behavior and its differences among smartphone users in Indonesia based on the demographic variables (i.e., gender, generation, educational background, and operating system) and four approaches, namely Avoiding Harmful Behavior, Settings, and Add-on Utilities, Preventive Behavior, and Disaster/Data Recovery. The data obtained from 400 respondents were processed using Pearson's chi-square and post hoc tests. The results showed that there are significant differences between the demographic variables and approaches. It was revealed that men behave better than women in terms of adopting settings and add-on utilities, preventive behavior, and disaster/data recovery. On the other hand, men tend to have riskier behavior than women in avoiding harmful behavior. Based on generation, it was found that Generation Z exhibits more secure behavior than Generation Y in terms of settings and add-on utilities regarding remote device locking. Meanwhile, Generation Z has better behavior than Generations X and Y in preventive behavior as they uninstall/remove unused applications. Furthermore, undergraduate users behave better than high schoolers in avoiding harmful behaviors such as sharing PIN/passwords. Lastly, iOS users were found to have better data recovery behavior than Android users in automatically backing up data in the cloud. These results can be considered when designing security education, training, and awareness programs to improve information security. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Although a goal was set in 2016 to make Indonesia the largest digital economy in ASEAN by 2020, the complexity of stakeholder interactions has become a major obstacle. Fostering a healthy business ecosystem and collaboration among stakeholders has been difficult to achieve due to a lack of funding, talent, and trust. This paper developed “should-be” and “as-is” models of feasible action plans to enhance value co-creation interactions among stakeholders. We investigated how stakeholders perceive their roles and interactions to construct an “as-is” model using a soft operational research method, namely strategic options development and analysis (SODA). Next, we developed a “should-be” model from a service science perspective. By comparing the two models, we derived action plans and recommendations to guide stakeholders in creating digital creative ecosystems (DCEs) in Indonesia.

Managing Information Technology Risks to Achieve Business Goals: A Case of Pharmaceutical Company,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramadani, Luthfi""},{""Penulis"":""Izzati, Berlian Maulidya""},{""Penulis"":""Tarigan, Yosephine Mayagita""},{""Penulis"":""Rosanicha""}]","Extant literature has shown that sectoral characteristics play a critical role in business value creation through information technology (IT). Therefore, managing IT and its associated risks needs to consider specific industrial traits to understand the distinct business nature and regulations that shape IT-enabled business value creation. This study presents an in-depth analysis of business goals, IT processes, and IT risks in the case of a pharmaceutical company through which appropriate controls are designed to ensure business value creation through IT. Drawing on a case study of a pharmaceutical company in Indonesia, we found that managing IT risks in the pharmaceutical industry entails two main objectives: 1) ensuring compliance with external laws and regulations as well as internal policies, 2) supporting the optimization of business functions, processes, and costs. Throughout one year of engagement during the project, this study identified ten risks associated with the operation of business processes. Risks are dominated by moderate levels given the current state of controls and appetite, most of which emerge from the company’s existing internal processes. Internal actors are involved in all risks, with most events occurring due to laws and regulations. Further, the study designs and elaborates IT risk controls by drawing from COBIT 5 Seven Enablers. Overall, IT risk management through cascading processes of analysis ensures the alignment of IT risk controls with achieving business goals in the pharmaceutical industry. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

An Optimal Approach for Heart Sound Classification Using Grid Search in Hyperparameter Optimization of Machine Learning,"[{""Penulis"":""Fuadah, Yunendah Nur""},{""Penulis"":""Pramudito, Muhammad Adnan""},{""Penulis"":""Lim, Ki Moo""}]","Heart-sound auscultation is one of the most widely used approaches for detecting cardiovascular disorders. Diagnosing abnormalities of heart sound using a stethoscope depends on the physician’s skill and judgment. Several studies have shown promising results in automatically detecting cardiovascular disorders based on heart-sound signals. However, the accuracy performance needs to be enhanced as automated heart-sound classification aids in the early detection and prevention of the dangerous effects of cardiovascular problems. In this study, an optimal heart-sound classification method based on machine learning technologies for cardiovascular disease prediction is performed. It consists of three steps: pre-processing that sets the 5 s duration of the PhysioNet Challenge 2016 and 2022 datasets, feature extraction using Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), and classification using grid search for hyperparameter tuning of several classifier algorithms including k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The five-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The best model obtained classification accuracy of 95.78% and 76.31%, which was assessed using PhysioNet Challenge 2016 and 2022, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the suggested approach obtained excellent classification results using PhysioNet Challenge 2016 and showed promising results using PhysioNet Challenge 2022. Therefore, the proposed method has been potentially developed as an additional tool to facilitate the medical practitioner in diagnosing the abnormality of the heart sound. © 2022 by the authors.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Analysis of the Effect of Dimensional Variation and Number of Air Inlets on the Efficiency of Gasification Stoves using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Simulation,"[{""Penulis"":""Rezki, Rachmad""},{""Penulis"":""Suwandi""},{""Penulis"":""Utami, Amaliyah Rohsari Indah""}]","Nowadays, the consumption of non-renewable energy is high. As a result, the availability of this energy is decreasing. Because of this, other energy alternatives are needed. One example of another option is the use of biomass. An example of using biomass is the gasification process. This process was carried out in a device called a gasification stove, namely a gasifier. A gasifier has been developed to produce an optimal combustion system. The constraints in this development are costs for manufacture and the potential for failure. Therefore, simulations using Ansys Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software student versions were carried out to reduce the costs for manufacture and the potential for failure of the gasifier. The simulation contains dimensional variations and the number of air inlets of gasifier of downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier. Further, the influence of the dimensions and quantity of inlet that affect each design's efficiency and the temperature was examined. The simulation results show that the best dimensions for the downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier are height and diameter of 50cm; 14.5cm (A1), 144cm; 70cm (C1), and 900cm; 300cm (B3), respectively. The best number of air inlets of A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers is 6, 1, and 6, respectively. Thus, the efficiency of each gasifier A1, C1, and B3 are 11.393%, 9.354%, and 50.885%, respectively. Furthermore, the A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers temperatures were 1055.25 K, 1383.44 K, and 3580.15 K, respectively. Therefore, this study suggested that the gasifier development could be optimized using simulation to reduce manufacturing costs and failures.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Integrated photocatalysis-adsorption method for chromium wastewater treatment,"[{""Penulis"":""Sutisna""},{""Penulis"":""Wibowo, Edy""},{""Penulis"":""Setia Prameswari, Prayunda""}]","Nowadays, the development of TiO2-based composite materials has received much attention as part of an effort to increase TiO2′s photocatalytic activity so that it can be used in large-scale waste treatment. TiO2-natural zeolite (TiO2-NZ) hybrid composites, as an integrated photocatalysis-adsorption system, have been synthesized using the sol-gel method with varied zeolite masses (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 g). The photodegradation of Cr(VI) by TiO2-NZ composites was tested, and it was discovered that the sample with a variation of 1.5 g zeolite (TiO2-NZ/1.5) produced the highest Cr(VI) degradation. The combination of natural zeolite adsorption and TiO2 photocatalytic properties has resulted in an increase in the material's photocatalytic ability to degrade Cr(VI). The TiO2-NZ/1.5 sample has the highest Cr(VI) removal rate of up to 97 percent, according to our findings. Crystal changes, morphology, porosity, elemental composition, and optical properties of the composite with superior performance were investigated using XRD, SEM-EDS, the N2-adsorption-desorption isotherm, and UV–vis DRS. TiO2 synthesized by the sol-gel method was in the anatase phase and successfully immobilized on the zeolite surface. The incorporation of TiO2 on the surface of the zeolite has suppressed the crystal size and band gap energy of TiO2. On the other hand, the presence of TiO2 has increased the specific surface area of the zeolite. In general, a larger specific surface area can show better adsorption ability and provide more active sites in photocatalytic reactions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Heart Diagnose Application Using Bagging Algorithm,"[{""Penulis"":""Frasanta, Muhammad Akbar Haikal""},{""Penulis"":""Wijaya, Dedy Rahman""},{""Penulis"":""Nugroho, Heru""},{""Penulis"":""Fahrudin, Tora""}]","One of the many organs in the human body is the heart. The function of the heart is to pump blood all over the body. If the heart is suffering damage or interference, it could cause many harms to people starting from chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, and the worse is death. To prevent this is by doing a heart health check to get the treatment needed. However, the patients have to come to the hospital to do a heart health check, which costs a lot of money. Therefore, we propose another method of diagnosing heart disease. This study uses a machine learning bagging algorithm (random forest) to detect heart disease with two classes: no disease or disease. The evaluation results show that the bagging algorithm achieved 97.8% accuracy from the best optimal grid search parameters. It can be concluded that this proposed method can fairly discriminate heart disease.  © 2022 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

However, the battery is expensive and has a short lifespan. To obtain a competitive water cost, a battery capacity should be as small as possible. This study presents a novel strategy to prevent dumping energy and minimize battery capacity. PV-RO system with battery (PV-RO-Battery) and seasonal water storage tank (SWST) is investigated and its water cost is analyzed. This strategy ensures that all of the daily energy produced by the PV system is used to produce water in less than 24 h, avoiding the accumulation of storing daily excessive energy. Excess daily water production over daily demand is stored in SWST and is supplied to the source of demand when the water production is less than demand. A comparison of a PV-RO-Battery system with and without SWST is also conducted. The reduction of water cost was from 10.21 $/m3 to 2.31 $/m3 and 36.96 $/m3 to 3.06 $/m3 for the constant and variable demand, respectively. It means that the water cost from the system with SWST is only 20.5% and 8.3% of the system without SWST. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The Simulation of Monitoring System of Elephant Location in the Forest Using Internet of Things,"[{""Penulis"":""Rosmiati, Mia""},{""Penulis"":""Gita Indah H.""},{""Penulis"":""Mahardika, Manggar""}]","Elephants are animals whose population is decreasing every year throughout the world, this is because many people who take benefits to use elephant body parts to be used as medicine or accessories, because of this small number the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified Asian elephants as endangered animals. Based on data from the Indonesian Elephant Conservation Forum (FKGI), the total elephant population in 2016 is estimated to be around 1,724. FKGI also noted that more than 700 elephants have died in the last 10 years. The large number of poaching of wild elephants in the forest is due to the lack of forest rangers who can monitor the movement of elephants in the forest. In addition, the lack of adequate communication tools causes the difficulty in sending the position of elephants in the forest in real time, So by the system that integrating the LoRa Wan communication module with the Raspberry Pi, all stakeholders can monitor the movement of elephants in the forest in a real time even though there is no internet connection. The maximum distance for one observation point that can be observed by the receiver is 1000 m with an average data sending time of 60 seconds. So the number of repeaters needed to observe the movement of elephants in the forest becomes less.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

Recent studies on sustainability have focused mainly on links between ecological and economic sustainability. This exploratory study aims to explore institutional barriers and facilitators regarding the implementation of sustainability-oriented practices in the Indonesian batik industry and to provide policy recommendations. The Indonesian batik industry is well-known for its cultural heritage and for being part of the Indonesian identity. Batik products are mostly hand-crafted by women crafters. The study used in-depth insights from two focus groups conducted with entrepreneurs active in the batik industry, while also building on earlier empirical insights. The lack of customer knowledge and socio-cultural and regulatory factors were found to be barriers to sustainability in batik SMEs. Ecological, technological, socio-cultural, and political factors were found to facilitate achieving sustainability objectives. This study contributes to the sustainable entrepreneurship and women entrepreneurship literature by considering facilitators and barriers as they are experienced by batik entrepreneurs and by furthering the conceptualization of sustainable entrepreneurs as either “committed” or “followers”. © 2022 by the authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The government has held a COVID-19 vaccination program as an effort to deal with the COVID-19 problem since January 13, 2021. Many problems occurred due to difficulties in dividing the vaccination recipient areas. This is due to the large number of regions with different conditions for each region. One of the efforts to assist the process of processing large vaccination data is data mining techniques and using the clustering method with the K-medoids algorithm. In this study, data on COVID-19 vaccination was grouped in the East Jakarta area using the K-medoids algorithm clustering method. The calculation is carried out using the Euclidean Distance equation and the value of S > 0. The grouped area categories are at the kelurahan level which will then be divided into several clusters. The clustering process was carried out with RapidMiner on 267 kelurahan data on four main attributes, namely the number of targets, the number of vaccine doses 1, the number of vaccine doses 2, and the number of vaccine doses 3. The clustering process was carried out in 6 simulations with variations of k medoids as much as 2 to 7. The results of clustering show the best number of clusters obtained in the simulation is cluster 6 with the smallest Davies Bouldin Index (DBI) value of 0.209. The clusters obtained are clusters 0 to cluster 5. The cluster that is prioritized in giving vaccinations is cluster 2 with 67 items because its members are areas in DKI Jakarta and give a high score in cases of COVID-19 compared to other clusters.  © 2022 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to increase the efficiency of diagnosis at the early stage. This paper studies a support vector machine (SVM) combined with an extremely randomized trees classifier (extra-trees) to provide a diagnosis of breast cancer at the early stage based on risk factors. The extra-trees classifier was used to remove irrelevant features, while SVM was utilized to diagnose the breast cancer status. A breast cancer dataset consisting of 116 subjects was utilized by machine learning models to predict breast cancer, while the stratified 10-fold cross-validation was employed for the model evaluation. Our proposed combined SVM and extra-trees model reached the highest accuracy up to 80.23%, which was significantly better than the other ML model. The experimental results demonstrated that by applying extra-trees-based feature selection, the average ML prediction accuracy was improved by up to 7.29% as contrasted to ML without the feature selection method. Our proposed model is expected to increase the efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis based on risk factors.

Enhanced Technology for Logistics Courier Delivery Using RFID Label to Minimize Processing Time,"[{""Penulis"":""Novitasari, Nia""},{""Penulis"":""Anwar, Nashirudin""}]","Courier services have become a sector that has experienced a growth spurt during the Covid-19 pandemic. The soaring growth of courier services is due to e-commerce in Indonesia. Increased people's digital activities show this during the pandemic, including online or online shopping. Data from the Indonesian Ministry of Finance shows that purchase transactions via e-commerce increased 18.1 percent to 98.3 million, with a total transaction value of 9.9 percent to Rp20.7 trillion. Fast and efficient delivery and pick-up of goods is the core operation of courier services. The biggest challenge for courier service providers is how to compete with other companies that offer the same type of service. Service users are increasingly demanding the security and reliability of delivery services so that they can meet the expectations of service users. The expectations of service users used as targets for company achievement are (1) reliability (on time, accuracy, integrity), (2) convenience (collecting units, delivery coverage, operating hours), (3) services, and (4) cost. Based on the activities in courier services, the potential for errors or inefficiencies in processing time is in the pre-delivery activities. In the pre-delivery activity is also the initial activity used to input the data base, collect goods, distribute goods and so on. This research proposes that RFID Label technology can overcome errors and increase process time efficiency in shipping goods on courier services, especially in pre-delivery and delivery activities. © 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Weighted Round Robin (WRR) Based Replenishment Model in Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) System,"[{""Penulis"":""Kusuma, Purba Daru""}]","Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is a popular supply chain system where vendor or supplier take responsibility and decision in managing its customers' inventory. Two important goals of the VMI are improving service level and maintaining inventory still low and available. Many studies in VMI compare their performance with the traditional system. Unfortunately, studies in improving VMI performance are rare. This work aims to improve VMI by implementing Weighted Round Robin (WRR), a popular scheduling model in computer system, in the replenishment model in VMI. WRR is popular because of its load balancing nature. Environment in this work is two-echelon supply chain. The vendor is a multi-product manufacturer. The customers are retailers. This WRR based replenishment model is then compared with two common replenishment models: (s, S) model and (r, Q) model. In this work, we observe two performance parameters: sales and inventory condition. Based on the simulation result, it is shown that the WRR model performs better than the existing (s, S) model and (r, Q) model and it occurs in most of the observed variables. In the certain condition, performance of the WRR model compared with the (s, S) model and the (r, Q) model is as follows. The WRR model performs 31 percent better than the (s, S) model and 12 percent better than the (r, Q) model in success ratio. Manufacturer's stock in the WRR model is only 36 percent than in the (s, S) model and 40 percent than in the (r, Q) model.

Therefore, this study aims to develop a reliable prediction model to predict D.O. in the Fei-Tsui reservoir for better water quality monitoring. The proposed model is an artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer. Twenty-nine years of water quality data have been used to validate the accuracy of the proposed model. A different number of neurons have been investigated to optimize the model's accuracy. Statistical indices have been used to examine the reliability of the model. In addition to that, sensitivity analysis has been carried out to investigate the model's sensitivity to the input parameters. The results revealed the proposed model capable of capturing the dissolved oxygen's nonlinearity with an acceptable level of accuracy where the R-squared value was equal to 0.98. The optimum number of neurons was found to be equal to 15-neuron. Sensitivity analysis shows that the model can predict D.O. where four input parameters have been included as input where the d-factor value was equal to 0.010. This main achievement and finding will significantly impact the water quality status in reservoirs. Having such a simple and accurate model embedded in IoT devices to monitor and predict water quality parameters in real-time would ease the decision-makers and managers to control the pollution risk and support their decisions to improve water quality in reservoirs. © 2022, The Author(s).","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

While the usage of social media has grown rapidly, it has caused numerous concerns. The literature on the motivations for women to use social media is edifying, but the results may not reveal the holistic continuum of social media usage motives among Malaysian housewives due to several distinctive and dynamic circumstances of this marginalised group. This study delves into housewives’ motives for social media usage and its effects on their well-being and flourishing based on the uses and gratification theory. Five motives have been proposed, namely escapism, information seeking, friendship maintenance, relationship initiation, and nostalgia, which were then tested for well-being and flourishing. In Study 1, a total of 268 housewives in Malaysia, who are active users of social media in their daily lives were involved in the survey. Data were analysed using SPSS v.23 and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3.1 applications. Meanwhile Study 2 was conducted by using focus group discussions with ten housewives. The findings of Study 1 revealed that motives of social media usage among housewives have a significant and positive impact on both well-being and flourishing. In contrast, Study 2 found five themes that emerged from the thematic analysis, strengthening relationships, emotional support, encouraging thoughts and characters, side income and support system, and acknowledgement of enrichment.

This paper presents scheduling algorithms in wireless industrial networks for factory automation in wireless sensor networks using the TD-LTE system. To satisfy real-time requirements, scheduling algorithms based on bio-inspired optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and firefly algorithm (FA), and dynamic frame configuration (DFC) are proposed to cover more nodes. Furthermore, the performances of these algorithms with and without DFC are evaluated. © 2022 IETE.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The effects of gender and age on factors that influence purchase intentions and behaviours of e-commerce consumers in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Alfanur, Farah""},{""Penulis"":""Kadono, Yasuo""}]","This study aims to provide new learning from consumer behaviour viewpoints by understanding the effects of gender and age on consumer purchase intentions and purchase behaviours, specifically in the context of e-commerce in Indonesia, by developing a hypothetical structural model that comprises nine motivational factors: convenience, perceived website quality, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, economic reasons, security, variety and delivery. The results of statistical analysis of data collected from 400 e-commerce consumers using structural equation modelling indicate that males are affected by perceived website quality and convenience, while females are affected by security, economic reasons, convenience and social influence. Furthermore, consumers under 30 years old are affected by convenience and perceived website quality, while consumers who were 30 years old and above are affected by facilitating conditions, economic reasons, security and social influence. Thus, the associations of social influence, economic reasons and security with purchase intention are moderated by gender and age. These findings are beneficial for e-commerce research and businesses from the viewpoint of Indonesian consumers' motivations categorised according to gender and age.

Many argue that online learning is the current educational crisis. Several studies show how complicated the handling of COVID-19 for universities is, especially in online learning (e-learning) outcomes. The variables influencing online learning during the COVID-19 epidemic have been shown in numerous studies. However, the influence of several other factors still needs to be investigated. Therefore, this study aims to determine non-academic factors that affect online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. With data collected from the International University of Logistics and Business (ULBI), this study uses Cronbach's-Alpha analysis, Bayesian Exploratory Factor Analysis (BEFA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Multivariate Regression Analysis. The evaluation of the research scale shows 20 observed variables. The test results prove that three non-academic factors influence students' online learning outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: education cost policy (H1), communication quality (H2), and student support (H3). Each factor has p - value < 0.001, p - value = 0.029, and p - value = 0.004, respectively. Meanwhile, family circumstances do not affect students' online learning outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic (H4 rejected) because the p-value is 0.152. An example case in the questionnaire shows that most students say family income can adapt to changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.  © 2022 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Join Classifier of Type and Index Mutation on Lung Cancer DNA Using Sequential Labeling Model,"[{""Penulis"":""Wisesty, Untari Novia""},{""Penulis"":""Purwarianti, Ayu""},{""Penulis"":""Pancoro, Adi""},{""Penulis"":""Chattopadhyay, Amrita""},{""Penulis"":""Phan, Nam Nhut""},{""Penulis"":""Chuang, Eric Y.""},{""Penulis"":""Mengko, Tati Rajab""}]","The sequential labeling model is commonly used for time series or sequence data where each instance label is classified using previous instance label. In this work, a sequential labeling model is proposed as a new approach to detect the type and index mutations simultaneously, using DNA sequences from lung cancer study cases. The methods used are One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU). Each nucleotide in the patient's DNA sequence is classified as either normal or with a certain type of mutation in which case, its index mutation is predicted. The mutation types detected are either substitution, insertion, deletion, or delins (deletion insertion) mutations. Based on the experiments that were conducted using EGFR gene, BiLSTM and Bi-GRU displayed better performance and were more stable than 1D-CNN. Further tests were carried out on the TP53, KRAS, CTNNB1, SMARCA4, CDKN2A, PTPRD, BRAF, ERBB2, and PTPRT gene. The proposed model reports F1-scores of 0.9596, and 0.9612 using Bi-GRU and BiLSTM, respectively. Based on the results the model can successfully detect the type and index mutations in the DNA sequence more accurately and faster without the need for other supporting data and tools, and does not require re-alignment to reference sequences. This will greatly facilitate the user in detecting type and index mutations faster by entering only the DNA sequence. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

As the pollutants tend to move due to the metrological condition. Naturally, pollutants will be deposited to the ground at the end part of the deposition cycle. One of the factors of pollutant deposition in a wet deposition is rain. The soluble pollutants and particulate matter are precipitated to the earth's surface during precipitation. In order to analyse it, we need a rainfall measuring device/rain gauge, as rainfall is an important parameter to find the correlation between the two. However, there is a limited number of rain-gauge in Indonesia. Thus, we proposed a tipping bucket rain gauge, which consists of a funnel, a bucket, a magnetic switch sensor, and a microcontroller-based processing unit. The prototype is equipped with a GSM module so that the data can be sent in real-time via text message every minute, also an SD Card as the backup storage data. It was calibrated using ISO 17025:2005 standard, the result obtained by a resolution of 0.2 mm/tip with a capacity of 4.2 ml buckets, and U95 uncertainty of ±0,04 - ±0,12 mm/minute. To find the suitable method of rainfall calculation for the prototype, we observe three methods, Natural, Meteorology, and Novel-IAP.

Power Allocation Based LSTM-FCN in D2D Underlaying with Multi-Cell Cellular Network,"[{""Penulis"":""Wulandari, Astri""},{""Penulis"":""Fahmi, Arfianto""},{""Penulis"":""Adriansyah, Nachwan Mufti""}]","Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is one of the key technologies to achieving higher speeds, lower latency, and less energy. D2D communication is direct link communication between two communication devices, meaning that communication can occur without going through the base station. However, because communication occurs without going through the base station and D2D users do not have their resources, D2D users simultaneously use the resources owned by Cellular User Equipment (CUE) to communicate and cause interference. Power allocation is optimized to mitigate the interference between D2D users and CUEs and maximize the system's overall sum rate. The traditional power allocation scheme in D2D communication still has problems related to the efficiency of the allocation, coordination of interference, and limitations for operating in real-time systems. This work focuses on designing the Long Short Term Memory with Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN) algorithm suitable for the power control problem on a D2D underlay communication system with an uplink-side multi-cell scheme. The simulation results show that enhancement of CUE can increase the system's sum rate and energy efficiency. At the same time, enhancement of the D2D pair can also increase the sum rate but decrease energy efficiency. Both LSTM-FCN, LSTM, and FCN can approximate the performance of the conventional scheme (CA-based algorithm). Besides that, LSTM-FCN gets the smallest time complexity compared to the other two algorithms and gets the closest performance to CA in both scenarios above 97% accuracy.  © 2022 IEEE.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Nature has become a victim of human economic activity, especially in developing countries. This paper analyzes a group of local community entities in Indonesia that live side by side with nature. This paper explores self-governance in three local community entities in Indonesia. The Baduy community, the Simanau community, and the Rumbiocommunity are examples of people who uphold their customs to live side by side with nature. They have Self-governance to regulate the lifestyle of their people to live simply with nature. The Baduy community represents self-governance in Banten Province, where they highly uphold the customs handed down from their ancestors. The Simanau people in West Sumatra Province can manage forest resources well and apply severe penalties for those who violate their rules. The Rumbio community in Riau Province is sage in managing the customary prohibition forest. The self-governance that has been implemented so far has gone quite well. By regulation, the applied self-governance does not conflict with the formal rules that apply in Indonesia. This paper is a reflection that humans can live in harmony with nature. © 2022","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Underwater noise impact of a ferry route on dive patterns of transiting Baltic ringed seals,"[{""Penulis"":""Prawirasasra, Muhammad Saladin""},{""Penulis"":""Jüssi, Mart""},{""Penulis"":""Mustonen, Mirko""},{""Penulis"":""Klauson, Aleksander""}]","To understand the impact of underwater anthropogenic noise on marine life, it is crucial to collect more data about the onset of behavioural reactions of marine species. Three free-ranging ringed seals (Phoca hispida botnica) were marked with GPS tags to track their movements in the Baltic Sea. The tracking data showed that ringed seals regularly transit between their haul-outs in the Väinameri and foraging areas in the southern part of the Gulf of Riga. On their way, the ringed seals pass through the Suur väin (Suur Strait) and have to cross the Virtsu–Kuivastu ferry route, where they are likely exposed to underwater ship-borne noise. Ringed seals’ dive profiles were studied for the presence of avoidance reactions in response to ship-radiated noise. As a result, some dive profile irregularities were noticed in the form of deep dives or multiple surfacings. The received level (RL) causing the disturbance in ringed seals’ behaviour was estimated based on sound propagation modelling. The obtained results are generally in line with previously reported studies on captive harbour seals and free-ranging grey seals. However, behavioural reactions observed in the current study are unlikely to adversely affect the energy budgets of ringed seals due to the short exposure time. © 2022 Authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

Proving the position of internal CSR as a resource that can solve performance problems needs to be done. This study aims to analyze the role of internal corporate social responsibility as a predictor of motivation to serve, normative commitment, and adaptive performance in Pandemic COVID 19 among State-owned enterprises Employees. The research design used causal studies to test the influence by using a survey of 289 employees holding State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) of the defense industry non-managers who were randomly selected. Findings of research show the motivation for high performance grows in line with the attention and support of the company at the time of pandemic with the existence of internal corporate social responsibility. Normative commitments increase and impact adaptive performance. Performance grows along with the activation of personal norms (moral responsibility) and the activity of individual values as employees in State-owned enterprises. The employees identify themselves as part of an organization that must devote itself to the interests of the state. Internal corporate social responsibility influences adaptive performance both directly and through motivation to serve and normative commitment. Theoretical implications are focused on developing ethical theories that underlie motivation to serve and normative commitments. Practical implications are focused on efforts to realize internal corporate social responsibility based on the foundation that is sourced on environmental ethical awareness.

This system claims to be able to sense several parameters related to the environmental conditions of a plant. Through the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study looks at the level of readiness for the adoption of the proposed technology. With the addition of the system features of Piots Tanah variable at TAM, there are 4 hypotheses on this research. The reason for this variable is added, because it is clear that the system features offered have an impact on user intention. Furthermore, each instrument variable from the questionnaire has a question guaranteed validity. Seen from the Cronbach alpha result, each value of alpha of all variables is greater than 0.7 and the average value is 0.736. Then, the results of the questionnaire distributed to users have been eligible for hypothesis testing using regression analysis. H1, H2, H3, and H4 are accepted, because p for each hypothesis is ≤ 0.05. With the highest value of β owned by Hypothesis 4, there is a positive effect on behavioral intention from attitude. In fact, R2 also shows a declining value (R2 on attitude 0.38 and R2 on behavioral intention = 0.43).

PCA-AdaBoost Method for a Low Bias and Low Dimension Toxic Comment Classification.,"[{""Penulis"":""Fauzan, Mohamad Nurkamal""},{""Penulis"":""Putrada, Aji Gautama""},{""Penulis"":""Alamsyah, Nur""},{""Penulis"":""Pane, Syafrial Fachri""}]","Toxic comment classification can be a solution to reduce the impact of one of these forms of online harassment, where the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectoring method can do feature extraction on comment text datasets. However, TF-IDF vectoring can result in a curse of dimensionality, which increases the computational cost exponentially. In addition, imbalanced data can also reduce classification performance. This study proposes the PCA-AdaBoost method for toxic comment classification with low dimension and low bias. We use the Jigsaw toxic comment classification dataset from Kaggle and apply AFINN's lexicon for labeling toxic comments. DT and RF are two methods to benchmark the performance of our proposed classification method. The performance test applies several methods such as K-fold cross-validation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under curve (AUC) value, confusion matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The test results show that the application of PCA produces a Dimension Reduction that equals 7.3%, where 275 new features from dimension reduction have a Total Explained Variance of 96.6%. In addition, the results of the cross-validation test show that PCA can provide improved performance and a more robust classification model. Then the proposed PCAAdaBoost has the best Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score compared to benchmark methods, namely, 0.86, 0.89, 0.82, and 0.85 respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

COGS Report Customization Design for Profitability Analysis with ABAP List Viewer: Case Study of a Telecommunication Enterprise,"[{""Penulis"":""Febrianti, Fatma Kurnia""},{""Penulis"":""Saputra, Muhardi""},{""Penulis"":""Puspitasari, Warih""}]","Along with revenue, one of the necessary metrics in calculating gross profit for profitability analysis is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). The objective of measuring profitability with gross profit is to reckon how efficient an enterprise manages the labors and supplies in carrying out the production process or services provision. In allocating COGS for product profitability analysis, Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is a costing technique that allows cost allocation based on the activities carried out in the production process. Companies from various industries have adopted ABC with available supporting tools like ERP system. This paper will discuss a case study of a telecommunications company in Indonesia that implements SAP S/4HANA for the cost allocation with ABC and profitability analysis processes. The company still faces shortcomings in its daily business operation, particularly profitability analysis reporting. The current COGS report for profitability analysis in the implemented system does not provide information about the source of the cost allocation, thus causing it hard to trace and further analyze the cost of activities contributing to the production of a product. Report customization can be a solution to accommodate the information needed. This research explains the designing of report customization with ABAP List Viewer (ALV) by applying iterative incremental model approach. Customization of the report reduces the steps needed to trace and analyze business process sources from the allocated COGS of a product to only one single step. The results presented in this paper may provide a solution for tracing cost allocation sources to analyze and determine the proper course of action regarding profitability and cost management.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Even though the existing literature is intensively discussed, mostly focusing on the educational tourism demand from an individual consumer's perspective, this study makes an innovation in line with the aggregate demand view. The study uses data that consist of the enrolment of international students from 47 home countries who studied in Malaysia from 2008 to 2017. The study utilised the dynamic panel method of analysis. Findings: This study affirms that income per capita, educational tourism price, price of competitor countries and quality of universities based on accredited programmes and world university ranking are the determinants of educational tourism demand in both the short and the long term. Also, a dynamic effect exists in educational tourism demand. Research limitations/implications: The results imply that government should take the quality of services for existing students, price decisions and QU into account to promote the country as a tertiary education hub and achieve sustainable development. Originality/value: Research on the determinants of the demand for educational tourism is rare in terms of macro data, and this study includes the roles of QU, competitor countries and dynamic effects. © 2022, Siti Hajar Hussein, Suhal Kusairi and Fathilah Ismail.","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Design of a Geographic Information System for Forest and Land Fires Based on a Real-Time Database on Microservices Infrastructure,"[{""Penulis"":""Mudrikah, F. Zahra' Aqilah""},{""Penulis"":""Istikmal""},{""Penulis"":""Aditya, Bagus""}]","Forest and land fires are an increasingly common problem in Indonesia. Fire cases that often occur require a system that is able to detect fires and provide information to users remotely to reduce the impact of fires. Along with the development of hardware technology such as computers, the use of GIS seems to be an effective shortcut in analyzing an event. Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized application workloads, offering declarative configuration and automation. This research designs a Google Maps API System tool for forest and land fires using a real-time database on microservices infrastructure with outputs in the form of fire locations and the results of sensor readings used. Broadly speaking, the processes that occur in the design of the location of forest fire points will be detected by sensors. Then firebase will store forest fire data which will simultaneously be updated on the website. Clients can see the point of forest fires through a browser on their respective desktops. Based on the results of the performance tests that have been carried out, it can be concluded that the use of Kubernetes microclusters can provide advantages when compared to those built monolithically, because Kubernetes microclusters have several advantages, namely having the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler feature, and the Kubernetes microcluster manages components and related services well. Then for each test performed, there was no significant change in memory usage. In the analysis of the results of the comparison data with 7 tests that have been carried out there are 6 tests which mean that the service built with the Kubernetes microcluster is superior to the monolithic one, namely hits per second 2354 ms, latency 3599 ms, response code 720 success code, cpu utilization 13.84%, error rate error rate 0.00%, and throughput 112/sec.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Study of Feature Extraction Algorithms on Photoplethysmography (PPG) Signals to Detect Coronary Heart Disease,"[{""Penulis"":""Ihsan, Muhammad Fadhil""},{""Penulis"":""Mandala, Satria""},{""Penulis"":""Pramudyo, Miftah""}]","Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the most dangerous heart disease, this disease occurs, when the blood supply containing oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle blocked by plaque in the heart blood vessels or coronary arteries. Currently, there are many ways of diagnosing coronary heart disease, starting from using ECG to Cardiac catheterization. However, it has some drawbacks, including the inflexibility of diagnosing quickly and invasive procedures. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a strong indication of cardiovascular diseases; as a result, any change in the normal heart rate (or blood volume) activity is a major marker for a potential cardiovascular malfunction. Through a series of waves and peak detection, photoplethysmography (PPG) detects blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and cardiac output. In recent years, there have been more studies using ECG signals to detect CHD compared to PPG signals, especially those discussing feature extraction on PPG signals in detecting CHD because this greatly affects the accuracy of CHD detection. In this study, proposed a literature study of feature extraction algorithm for detecting coronary heart disease using photoplethysmography. For the feature extraction, three algorithm will be discussed are respiratory rate (RR) interval, HRV Features and Time Domain Features. HRV features, with 94.4% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 90.9% specificity, is the best feature extraction approach of the three proposed techniques using decision tree classifier.  © 2022 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Open Innovation in Organization Through Stakeholder Capability During Pandemic (COVID-19): Indonesian SMEs Perspective,"[{""Penulis"":""Rumanti, Augustina Asih""},{""Penulis"":""Aisha, Atya Nur""},{""Penulis"":""Rizana, Afrin Fauzya""},{""Penulis"":""Septiningrum, Lutfia""}]","This study aims to analyze the role of stakeholders who support the open innovation transition in SMEs. This is important because the innovation process has shifted from closed innovation to open innovation which requires good management of organizational capabilities, especially in managing stakeholders and resources owned by the organization. However, in the current pandemic situation, SMEs have challenges in adopting and implementing these open innovations. In this study, a conceptual research model was compiled and produced which elaborated several previous references, and then tested empirically on respondents, namely in SMEs in Indonesia. The responses involved in this study were 218 SMEs, but the complete response are 206 respondents. Data testing was carried out using the Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) statistical method. The results of hypothesis testing indicate that there are four variables that significantly strengthen the effect of closed innovation on open innovation, namely financial capability, network, knowledge management system, and organizational culture (p < 0.01). The moderating variable with the most dominant influence is financial ability ( $\beta =0.915$ , p < 0.01). Based on the results of this study, SMEs that have high financial capabilities or have advantages in terms of funding and financial management can make the transition from closed innovation to open innovation better or independently. There is one moderating variable that is not proven to be significant, namely technology. These findings can then be used to formulate appropriate policies to support the adoption of open innovation in the context of developing the ability of SMEs to survive during the pandemic.  © 2013 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Determinant factors of lean start-up-based incubation metrics on post-incubation start-up viability: case-based study,"[{""Penulis"":""Tritoasmoro, Iwan Iwut""},{""Penulis"":""Ciptomulyono, Udisubakti""},{""Penulis"":""Dhewanto, Wawan""},{""Penulis"":""Taufik, Tatang Akhmad""}]","Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of business incubation metrics based on an adaptation of the lean start-up (LS) framework on start-up survival after incubation. This study also analyzes the obstacles in implementing the LS framework as incubation metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses mixed methods. Quantitative research using multiple linear regression was applied to the data of 30 start-ups incubated at Bandung Techno Park for the 2014–2017 period and survival tracking data after the incubation. A qualitative approach to complete the explanatory work was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 respondents, including start-up graduates from the incubation program, program managers and mentors. Findings: This study confirms that several LS incubation metrics significantly affect start-up sustainability after incubation. In addition, this study also explains several problems in applying the LS discipline that needs attention to increase incubation success. Research limitations/implications: Research was conducted only at one technology business incubator (TBI) model that focuses on digital start-ups in the emerging ecosystem. Research results can be biased in different situations and ecosystems. Practical implications: The explanation of the relationship of LS-based incubation metrics to the survival of start-ups, as well as the challenges of their implementation, can be a reference for TBI management to consider and prioritize intervention strategies, thereby improving TBI’s business processes and increasing the success rate of incubated start-ups. Social implications: The creation of university start-ups and spin-offs has become a key performance indicator mandatory for technology universities in Indonesia. The existence of TBI institutions in universities as channels of technology commercialization is essential. The incubator’s success in creating a new technology-based company will have a significant social impact on the surrounding environment. Originality/value: Although the LS method is popular in start-up communities and among practitioners, it is rarely used in the incubation process at universities. These results can be considered for university TBIs to explore LS as an incubation management tool to increase the success rate of incubated start-ups. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Transform Domain and Singular Value Decomposition for Robust and Imperceptible Image Watermarking,"[{""Penulis"":""Aufa, Muhammad Fikri""},{""Penulis"":""Novamizanti, Ledya""},{""Penulis"":""Purnamasari, Rita""}]","As technology advances at an ever-increasing rate, data is disseminated online through multimedia, particularly images, which are relatively simple to access. However, this situation is prone to theft of digital data and copyright infraction. A method to preserve and maintain multimedia data information, particularly images, is the robust watermarking approach. The implanted watermark can be recovered even after being altered by numerous techniques and will be difficult to erase. The host image is altered by redundant wavelets, and the suggested watermarking approach incorporates watermarks situated in the low and high-frequency sub-bands of the curvelet transform to provide a fair trade-off between robustness and imperceptibility. Applying a discrete cosine transform to the watermark causes it to be integrated into the image. Then, using the singular value decomposition approach, the watermark's unique value is added to the host image's unique value. The watermarked image is extracted on the receiving side in order to return the watermark to its original state. According to the study's findings, the scheme has a good imperceptibility and is resilient with a maximum peak signal to noise ratio value of 71.7630 dB, SSIM 1, NC 1, and BER 0. The suggested approach is resistant to attacks from Gaussian filter, rotation, and JPEG compression with noise that is (Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, speckle).  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Early diagnosis determines the prognosis. This study aimed to develop a risk assessment tool for early detection of ovarian cancer using artificial intelligence. To accomplish this, the presence of ten signs and symptoms reported by patients with ovarian cancer was assessed. Methods: This study was carried out as a cohort study of patients diagnosed with suspected ovarian tumors undergoing cytoreduction operation at Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from December 2019 to September 2020. Compared to ovarian cancer self-assessment through questionnaire, postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected ovarian tumors. The questionnaire proceeded by artificial intelligence is grouped into risk and no risk. Statistical analyses were done using Chi-Square and Exact Fisher Test. Result: In total, 115 patients included in this study. The differences were statistically significant in terms of the six variables (abdominal bloating, nausea/vomiting, decreased of appetite, fullness, menstrual disturbance, and weight loss) ovarian cancer self-assessment compared to postoperative histopathology with a tendency towards benign ovarian tumors (p[removed]0.05).

Internal Corporate Social Responsibility as a Microfoundation of Employee Well-Being and Job Performance,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramdhan, Rudy M.""},{""Penulis"":""Kisahwan, Daniel""},{""Penulis"":""Winarno, Alex""},{""Penulis"":""Hermana, Deni""}]","Very drastic environmental changes require the development of an adaptive performance management framework that supports the strengths of the company’s structure. The position of internal CSR as a resource that can solve performance problems needs to be proved. The purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of internal corporate social responsibility on job performance through employee well-being. To this end, this causal study surveyed 282 non-managerial employees at four strategic industrial state-owned enterprises in Indonesia. The respondents were recruited using the proportional random sampling technique. The collected data were analyzed using SEM with SPSS 26. The results showed that changes in job performance can be predicted by the adequacy of work resources and personal resources. Both resources can be realized by the existence of corporate social responsibility intended for employees. Internal corporate social responsibility was found to encourage increased work engagement and decrease burnout, which ultimately improves job performance. Internal CSR is an important personal and work resource for employees. Internal CSR is the company’s main orientation in an effort to strengthen the company’s performance structure while ensuring the implementation of the company’s ethical responsibility in its environment. From the theoretical perspective, this study implied the need for exploring the concept of internal corporate social responsibility to expand our understanding of the relationship between corporate social responsibility and personal and work resources and employee performance. Meanwhile, the practical implications of this study highlight the importance of microlevel corporate social responsibility programs to meet personal and work resource needs so that companies benefit from high employee engagement and low burnout in order to improve adaptive performance and the structure of the company’s performance. © 2022 by the authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The effect of micro sized graphite insertion on light absorption and output of TiO2based solar cell,"[{""Penulis"":""Fauzia, Jalilah""},{""Penulis"":""Handayani, Ismudiati Puri""},{""Penulis"":""Fitriani, Tahniah Ida""},{""Penulis"":""Subekti, Dhika Marlia""},{""Penulis"":""Rosi, Memoria""},{""Penulis"":""Rokhmat, Mamat""}]","The TiO2 based solar cells researches have attracted a lot of attention due to the simple fabrication process and relatively low production cost. However, this type of solar cell has the disadvantage due to its large band gap of 3.1 eV which generates low sun light absorption. To overcome this problem, the TiO2 is usually incorporated with dye or other nanoparticles. In this study, micro-sized graphite was inserted into anatase-TiO2 solar cells using the doctor blade and spin-coating methods. The morphology and the effect of graphite insertion on TiO2 to the absorption spectrum are characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis, respectively. Meanwhile, the efficiency of solar cell is determined from the I-V curve characterization. Generally the I-V curve characteristics is affected by the mass of graphite insertion, Even though the observed highest efficiency is 0.052 %, the graphite insertion is found to increase the light absorption about 75 % when 0.4 gram graphite is inserted to 0.7 gram TiO2 and deposited using doctor blade method. Furthermore, the I-V curve characteristics and efficiency can be modified by depositing the sample using spin coating method which tends to produce higher open circuit voltage and smaller short circuit method. A 350 mV open circuit voltage is observed for 1000 rpm spin coating. A higher efficiency is obtained for smaller rpm. This study shows how graphite insertion affects the light absorption and electrical properties of anatase-TiO2 based solar cell. © 2022 Author(s).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Therefore, careful network planning and determination of propagation characteristics are essential for designing a 5G NR cellular network. This research aims to design and assess the performance of a 5G NR network for the Indonesian urban area of Bandung city, using the balanced coverage and capacity, mid-band frequency of 3.5 GHz frequency and simulated using Forsk Atoll v3.4 software. This research utilizes both Line of Sight (LoS) and Non-Line of Sight (N-LoS) scenarios with the Urban Macro (Uma) propagation model based on the 3GPP v38.901 standard in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) for Outdoor to Outdoors (O2O). The LoS propagation scenario shows that UL requires 142 gNodeB (gNB), and DL requires 43 gNB. While the N-LoS propagation scenario delivers 2260 gNB for the UL and the DL requires as much as 560 gNB. The simulation results show that the N-LoS propagation design has a good SS-RSRP value with an average SS-RSRP value of -91.96 dBm and a fair SS-SINR value with an average SS-SINR value of 9.21 dB. On the other hand, N-LoS propagation uses an excellent SS-RSRP value with an average SS-RSRP value of -80.89 dBm and a good SS-SINR value with an average SS-SINR value of 10.49 dB. Thus, the deployment of 5G NR at 3.5 GHz can be implemented in Bandung city. © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Designing Green Hospital Non-Medical Waste Management System Based on ERP,"[{""Penulis"":""Fitriani, Annisa""},{""Penulis"":""Ridwan, Ari Yanuar""},{""Penulis"":""Septiningrum, Lutfia""}]","The waste produced by hospitals is broadly divided into medical waste and non-medical waste. Non-medical waste is generated from activities in hospitals outside of medical, which comes from kitchens, offices, parks, and yards that can be reused or destroyed. In addition to being a health facility, hospitals can also cause negative impacts, one of which is the waste they produce. These negative impacts include the place of disease transmission, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Many general hospitals still do not have an integrated non-medical waste management system that supports green hospitals. The non-medical waste management process, from the preparation to reporting stages, is still done manually. This manual process can cause several problems, such as non-medical waste monitoring, which cannot be done regularly, and the recording of the waste generated and the waste that has been managed is prone to errors. To support green hospitals in public hospitals, it is necessary to manage the waste generated by hospitals in an integrated manner to facilitate monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. This research will focus on designing and developing a non-medical waste management module using an ERP system that will integrate it with other elements, such as inventory, to make it easier for public hospitals to classify processed waste in storage warehouses. Not only that, but this system will simplify the preparation process for management, help determine the amount of waste generated, and can be monitored through non-medical waste indicators, which are then reported in the form of documents, making it easier for companies to analyze results and assist in further decision making.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

There are seven branches opened by this brand until 2021. Hence, it is interesting to study the phenomena. This study aims to determine the effect of product innovation on the competitive advantage of this culinary brand. Besides this, the customers’ evaluation regarding product innovation and competitive advantage is revealed by this study as well. This research uses a quantitative method by surveying with the purposive sampling technique. The questionnaires were distributed to 100 customers who had made transactions more than once within the last six months before the survey began. The descriptive data analysis was carried out to investigate the customers’ evaluation. It is examined that product innovation has a positive impact on the competitive advantage after a simple linear regression analysis was conducted. This result is strengthened by the t-test that shows the acceptance of the hypothesis. Moreover, the coefficient of determination test presents that the impact of product innovation on competitive advantage is 51 percent. It means that the product innovation has provided 51 percent of the information needed to predict the competitive advantage in this small culinary business. From the overall results of the descriptive analysis, the consumer assessment scores obtained fall into the medium to high category range. This result proves that the response given to the company’s competitive advantage and product innovation is still quite good and positive.

Utilizing Low-cost Mobile Monitoring to Estimate the PM2.5 Inhaled Dose in Urban Environment,"[{""Penulis"":""Munir, Muhammad Miftahul""},{""Penulis"":""Adrian, Martin""},{""Penulis"":""Saputra, Casmika""},{""Penulis"":""Lestari, Puji""}]","This study has developed a compact, low-cost, and real-time mobile monitoring (MM) device for estimating the PM2.5 inhaled dose. The MM device consists of a low-cost PM2.5 sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, Wi-Fi module, and microcontroller unit. The MM system (carried on vehicle) has been used to measure PM2.5 concentration, geolocation, and meteorological factors during rush hour. To examine repeatability, a new method was proposed to calculate the coefficient of variance of the PM2.5 sensor reading. We used several vehicle speeds to evaluate its dependency on the PM2.5 sensor reading. A sensor cover was also introduced to prevent the airspeed effect during carried on the vehicle. In this study, mobile monitoring was performing in several areas. The measured PM2.5 concentration then used for estimating PM2.5 inhaled dose. The Monte Carlo technique was used to introduce the probabilistic of body weight and PM2.5 concentration. The result shows that the coefficient of variation of the PM2.5 sensor reading was 2% on average in 2 minutes. We found that vehicle speed and sensor cover affects the standard deviation of PM2.5 sensor reading. Statistical analysis shows that the on-road area (53 µg m–3) has higher PM2.5 concentration than residential area (41 µg m–3). The area around the toll gate where many trucks pass has a higher concentration of PM2.5. In addition, low variability on the meteorological factors caused weak relationship with the PM2.5 concentration. We found that children were estimated to receive a higher inhaled dose of PM2.5 than adults. Therefore, variations in the microenvironment and local pollution sources such as truck and food stalls are dominant factors that affect spatial variation of PM2.5. Real-time mobile monitoring can help the government make policy and give warnings to people traveling around polluted areas. © The Author(s).","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Identification of Lung Cancer in Smoker Person Using Ensemble Methods Based on Gene Expression Data,"[{""Penulis"":""Abiezer, Otniel""},{""Penulis"":""Nhita, Fhira""},{""Penulis"":""Kurniawan, Isman""}]","Cancer is a symptom of abnormal cell growth and is uncontrollable. Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. Early detection is essential because it can prevent lung cancer and get the proper treatment, such as a low-dose CT scan (LDCT). However, this effort still has drawbacks. With advances in DNA microarray technology, it is possible to measure the gene expression level of thousands of genes or cells in each tissue. The identification of lung cancer can be made using machine learning from the gene expression data (DNA microarray).

QSAR Study on Falcipain Inhibitors as Anti-malaria using Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine,"[{""Penulis"":""Ambiar, Muhamad Farell""},{""Penulis"":""Aditsania, Annisa""},{""Penulis"":""Kurniawan, Isman""}]","Malaria is a dangerous endemic disease that infects millions yearly. The Plasmodium falciparum species are responsible for most malaria deaths. Currently, most available antimalarial drugs are less effective due to the increased parasite's resistance to drugs. Hence, novel antimalarial agents with high efficiency to inhibit malaria are urgently needed. Falcipain enzyme is a promising target protein for developing new anti-malaria. However, conventional laboratory testing to design new drugs takes time and is very expensive. Therefore, the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) can be used to accelerate the drug design process. In this study, we developed a QSAR model using a genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) to predict the pIC50 values of falcipain inhibitors. The GA was utilized as a feature selection method, while SVM with an optimized hyperparameter was used to develop the prediction models. We performed three models with different SVM kernels, i.e., linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial. The model performance was validated using both internal and external data. The validation results show that the RBF model produced the best result, with the $R^{2}$ values of the training and test sets of 0.98 and 0.84, respectively, while $Q^{2}$ of the leave-one-out cross-validation was 0.85.  © 2022 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Binary Data Correction Simulation Using Convolutional Code on Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel,"[{""Penulis"":""Nuha, Hilal H.""},{""Penulis"":""Zani, Tafta""},{""Penulis"":""Ridha, Muhammad Fadhly""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""}]","Access to digital communications in remote areas requires a mechanism to increase the robustness of the transmitted data. Many areas in Indonesia still have difficulty accessing the Internet. This is because the location of the settlement is remote from the signal transmitter Convolutional codes are a technique to improve the reliability of data transmission. This article contains a simulation process of Convolutional Code from an application that we developed using Java. The basic difference between block codes and convolution codes in designing and evaluating is that Block codes are based on algebraic techniques or a combination whereas ConvCode based on construction techniques. Some of the excellent features of this application are demo encoding, modulation, noise generation on white Gaussian noise channels, and decoding using the Viterbi algorithm. The error correcting code process begins by checking the bit similarity (hamming distance) in the code word with the trellis diagram which will produce a path with weights depending on the hamming distance. With the Viterbi Algorithm, we will decode the codeword into the initial code by finding the highest probability (Maximum Likelihood) based on the Hamming distance from each state. Experiments show that the application successfully demonstrates the system's reliability to recover information signals damaged by noise.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

During the Covid-19 era, there was a lot of negative information about the uncertainty of the market, which made investors irrational about the choice of stocks in the portfolio. So this research will have a hypothesis that the High Volatility stock group will be the best portfolio in Covid-19 conditions. The sample used is the Group of stocks that have the largest market capitalization value in JCI. Stocks with large market caps are chosen because of one of the indicators of blue chip stock. The sample will be divided into three portfolio groups, High Volatility, Moderate Volatility, and Low Volatility. The results obtained that High Volatility became the best portfolio during the Covid-19 period. The results of this study prove that the group of stocks with High Volatility will get positive returns and sharpe performance results are the highest and positive, compared to moderate volatility and low volatility portfolios. This result arises because stocks with High Volatility are subject to large price fluctuations and in this situation, investors can invest in these stocks in a short time frame.

The moderating effect of social media use in impulsive buying of personal protective equipments during the COVID-19 pandemic,"[{""Penulis"":""Elisa, Hanifah Putri""},{""Penulis"":""Fakhri, Mahendra""},{""Penulis"":""Pradana, Mahir""}]","The global economy, public health, and markets are now being greatly affected by the spread of COVID-19. Indonesia is one of the countries affected. These effects cause fear, panic, and anxiety for many people. When the lockdown was applied, panic buying becomes common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is essential to investigate consumer purchasing behavior during COVID-19 to understand the phenomenon better and provide management insights to policymakers and marketers. This research utilized the scarcity model theory and the Stimuli-Organism-Response (SOR) model. We investigated how creating external stimuli such as scarcity affects perceived value among people in panic situations, which in turn affects impulsive buying behavior. Finally, 320 valid data points were collected using online surveys, and SmartPLS was used for data analysis. Our results show that scarcity significantly increases impulse buying. In addition, our results show that social media use moderates the relationship between scarcity messages and impulsive buying, while perceived value mediates the relationship between scarcity and impulsive buying in Indonesia. The study provides more information about consumers’ impulsive buying, considering the scarcity of health supplement products during pandemics. Marketers and the Indonesian government can take action to mitigate their impact and help maintain security during pandemics. © 2022 The Author(s).

Indonesia is one of the well-known countries with incredible destinations to visit by domestic and international tourists that are continuously growing. There are many ways to determine a suitable strategy to understand tourist behavior, such as tourist mobility, sentiment, and problem analysis. Using tourist reviews or user-generated content (UGC) data on the Tripadvisor website, we employ social network analysis (SNA) to identify tourist mobility, favorites, and in-between destination using network metrics and measurements. We use sentiment analysis to classify tourist sentiment and the multiclass text classification method to find various problems in tourist reviews. We also construct a text corpus for the tourism domain to classify tourism problems. The results represent the complex tourist mobility to recognize the favorite destination and the movement visualization to determine the crowded area, the tourist sentiment, and the tourist problem in Bali tourism destination.

"A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: Nexus between Critical Delay Factors, Leadership Self-Efficacy, and Transnational Mega Construction Project Success","[{""Penulis"":""Zaman, Umer""},{""Penulis"":""Florez-Perez, Laura""},{""Penulis"":""Abbasi, Saba""},{""Penulis"":""Nawaz, Shahid""},{""Penulis"":""Farías, Pablo""},{""Penulis"":""Pradana, Mahir""}]","Delay factors are frequent in the construction industry globally, resulting in significant overruns in project cost and time. In context, megaprojects can be more prone to critical delays, hence, demanding a high degree of self-confident leadership. Despite the continuous scholarly attempts to examine mega construction project success, the underlying role of critical delay factors and leadership self-efficacy has been largely overlooked. Hence, to address these rarely examined linkages, the present study empirically explored the effects of critical delay factors (CDFs) on transnational mega construction project (TMCP) success with the moderating influence of leadership self-efficacy (LSE). Based on a study sample (N = 211) extracted from the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, the hypothesized relationships were tested through partial least squares–structural equation modeling. The study included nine critical delay factors and three subdimensions of TMCP success, derived from previous research. The findings revealed a negative relationship between CDFs and TMCP success, as a 1% increase in CDFs triggered a 28.8% negative change in TMCP success. A positive moderating effect of LSE on the relationship between CDFs and TMCP success was also empirically supported, as 1% increase in LSE resulted in 18.4% positive change in TMCP success. The present study bridges the fragmented literature on critical delay factors in the global construction industry, megaproject success, and project leadership, by providing the first empirical evidence linking these potential relationships. Moreover, the present study also provides an extension to existing studies to identify the role of CDFs and LSE in impacting multi-faceted success (i.e., management success, ownership success, and investment success) in mega construction projects. © 2022 by the authors.

"The Use of Image Processing and Sensor in Tomato Sorting Machine by Color, Size, and Weight","[{""Penulis"":""Sari, Marlindia Ike""},{""Penulis"":""Fajar, Rizal""},{""Penulis"":""Gunawan, Tedi""},{""Penulis"":""Handayani, Rini""}]","Tomatoes are a popular vegetable in Indonesia, where production increases every year according to market demand. The large production requires proper post-harvest handling both in quality and time. It has been well-known that sorting and grading are the first and foremost processes in the post-harvest process of tomatoes. Sorting tomatoes can be conducted by color and adjusted to the target market. The automation process in the post-sorting and grading process can save time and resources. This research proposes a sorting system that sorts tomatoes based on color, size, and weight. Tomatoes are sorted by red, yellow, and green colors. The detection of color and size was carried out by image processing with the OpenCV library. The color detection was carried out by HSV's red, yellow, and green values. In comparison, the dimensional measurement was carried out by determining the outermost point of the detected object both vertically and horizontally. At the same time, tomatoes' weight was measured by a weight sensor. This system was implemented into a prototype sorting system with a webcam, Arduino, a conveyor, and motors. The final part was a storage box used to accommodate tomatoes based on grading. The implementation has the maximum results for detecting color with 100% accuracy and measuring weight with 95% accuracy. However, it still needs development for dimensional measurements. In this research, it has only 5% accuracy. This proposed system can be used both in software and hardware design as an inline tomato sorting tool. © 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Energy Distribution Image Processing of Stroke EEG Signal using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix,"[{""Penulis"":""Amalia, Safira""},{""Penulis"":""Usman, Koredianto""},{""Penulis"":""Fauzi, Hilman""}]","In this study, we propose the effect of Electroencephalography (EEG) stroke signal processing into energy distribution images using energy distribution for stroke conditions. The EEG signals are used as an alternative method to help the improvement of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to detect stroke conditions. The energy distribution clarifies the relationship for each channel while converting the EEG signal into an energy distribution image. The Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and ANN-BP are used as a method for image feature values to get the optimal system feature after brain mapping using Power Spectrum Density (PSD). We evaluate the system performances via a series of computer simulations. We investigate the feature combination using GLCM by taking the best 11 features, i.e., contrast, correlation, variance, entropy, homogeneity, energy, sum variance, sum entropy, difference variance, difference entropy and inverse difference momentum with an accuracy equal to 61.25%. Thus, the GA uses to select the feature on GLCM in order to find the best combination for the BCI system in this study. We found the accuracy value of GA-GLCM equals 72.5% with features, i.e., contrast, correlation, homogeneity, energy, sum variance, and different variance, while the EEG signal is tested with accuracy equals 59%. The result shows that the BCI system can be optimized using the converted EEG signal into energy distribution images.

Caused by 4 antigenically distinct but related virus serotypes, named DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers lifelong immunity to that serotype and a short period of temporary cross immunity to other related serotypes. Severe dengue is epidemiologically associated with a secondary infection caused by a heterologous serotype via the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), an immunological process enhancing a new infection. Within-host dengue modeling is restricted to a small number of studies so far. With many open questions, the understanding of immunopathogenesis of severe disease during recurrent infections is important to evaluate the impact of newly licensed vaccines. In this paper, we revisit the modeling framework proposed by Sebayang et al. and perform a detailed sensitivity analysis of the well-known biological parameters and its possible combinations to understand the existing data sets. Using numerical simulations, we investigate features of viral replication, antibody production, and infection clearance over time for three possible scenarios: primary infection, secondary infection caused by homologous serotype, and secondary infection caused by heterologous serotype. Besides, describing well the infection dynamics as reported in the immunology literature, our results provide information on parameter combinations to best describe the differences on the immunological dynamics of secondary infections with homologous and heterologous viruses.

A Jambi Coin with Kawi Inscription from Indonesia: Re-examination of a coin type formerly attributed to Siak,"[{""Penulis"":""Perdana, Aditya Bayu""}]","The Malay archipelago has a rich numismatic legacy. However, identification of many native coins is still a challenge to this day, especially for those found in Indonesia. This study aims to re-examine a particular coin type made of tin-lead alloy with suspected copper content, reported to be found in the Musi river in south Sumatra. Available literature presumed the coin as a Siak issue, based on rather unsatisfactory reading of its inscription. While native Malay coins typically used Arabic Jawi for their inscription, the coin is unusual in using Indic script that can be described as a transitional form between late Kawi and early Modern Javanese, somewhat inclined towards the former. Through letterform comparison with artefacts such as Nītisārasamuccaya, this author proposes a revised reading of pangéran ratu hing jambi, making this coin attributable to Jambi. The commercial success of the early 17th century Jambi sultanate and the propensity of its court to emulate Javanese-ness seemingly support this attribution. A narrower date range, however, could not be drawn as the inscription provides little orthographic or linguistic indications. Analogy with contemporaneous Banten copper coins suggests that the Jambi coin may have been used as a prestige item rather than common currency. © 2022 Editors, Indonesia and the Malay World.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

In this letter, we investigated the potency of active compounds of Brucea javanica (BJ) in treating hypertension by using network pharmacology combined with several in silico approaches, including molecular docking, homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Twenty protein targets at the intersection of BJ and hypertension were identified by using network pharmacology. We found that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) was the first-degree rank that might strongly connect with the disease. Therefore, the tertiary structure of PPARG, generated using homology modeling, was assigned as a receptor. In docking analysis, two ligands, i. e., Javanicin and Yadanziolide A, could be potential inhibitors for PPARG due to the higher binding energy score than the control (Hydrochlorothiazide). To confirm the stability of the ligand-receptor complex in water solvent, MD simulation was performed. We found that complexes 1 and 2 reached stable structures during the simulation indicated by no significant fluctuation in the validation parameters. Furthermore, based on the binding energies calculated by Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA), we confirm that the ligands of these complexes strongly bind to the catalytic site of the receptor. This points out the potency of these complexes as promising drugs against hypertension targeting PPARG. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Green economy is an economic concept that makes environmental sustainability an important part of realizing sustainable development goals (SDGs). The performance of MSMEs in terms of GE is a measure of how successful an MSME is in implementing the GE concept. Apart from GE, an equally important element regarding MSMEs is business digitization/digitalization. In the era of society 5.0, MSMEs are increasingly affected by digital technology while running their business. With digitalization, MSME managers can run their company in a more environmentally friendly way to align with the GE concept. Not all MSMEs are ready to implement the GE concept and digitalization, which is a serious problem that deserves attention. To produce a tangible solution related to the implementation of the GE concept and digitization requires a literature review. The literature review helps identify research gaps and formulate a theoretical process in terms of MSME readiness regarding the implementation of the GE concept and digitalization to the performance of GE MSMEs. There is still a limited research framework that comprehensively explains the readiness process related to the GE concept. The digitization of MSMEs on GE's performance is the background of this research.

This study used a quantitative approach with cross sectional design. The sample consisted of 76 mothers who have toddler with the sampling technique by accidental sampling. Primary data obtained directly from interviews using questionnaires and direct observation to respondents. The independent variable was Community-Based Total Sanitation which includes the behavior of open defecation, drinking water and food management, household waste management, and household waste water management. The results showed that only household wastewater management was significant with the incidence of diarrhea in toddlers (p value 0,0000; OR 5,2), while, open defecation (p value 0.118), drinking water and household food management (p value 1,000), household waste management (p value 0,979) was not related to the incidence of diarrhea in toddlers. Toddlers in households with poor wastewater treatment were 5,2 times more likely to have diarrhea. The conclusion is household wastewater management was significant with the incidence of diarrhea in toddlers, so that innovative efforts are needed so that the community improves their waste management. This is useful for preventing the occurrence of diarrhea in toddlers. © 2022","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Web-Based Sentiment Analysis Application of Hotel Reviews in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramadhan, Rizki""},{""Penulis"":""Gunawan, Putu Harry""},{""Penulis"":""Aquarini, Narita""}]","For many nations, including Indonesia, tourism is crucial. Following the oil and gas sector, tourism is Indonesia's second-largest source of foreign currency earnings. A comfortable operation of tourism activities depends on the presence of amenities like hotels and tourist attractions. To ensure that tourism operates smoothly, it is also crucial to understand the meaning behind customer feedback to maintain good facilities and services and improve inadequate or poor facilities. The data used in this work is based on reviews of 150 hotels in the 'Best Value Hotels' category in Indonesia from the Tripadvisor website. The reviews contained in the data are reviews in the form of positive and negative. The data is then processed for machine learning model training to classify sentiments as positive or negative reviews. We then applied feature extraction methods such as Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling method and compared the three models' performance with and without using them. This work also implements the trained model into web-based application, so the user can perform sentiment analysis on hotel reviews independently. The result is the overall performance of the three models in performing sentiment analysis on hotel reviews are great.

Land Use for Renewable Energy Power Plant and the Impact of CO2 Emission: An Indonesian Case Study,"[{""Penulis"":""Priambodo, Nur Widi""},{""Penulis"":""Raharjo, Jangkung""},{""Penulis"":""Rokhmat, Mamat""}]","The energy crisis, global warming, emissions, and greenhouse gas effects have become a global issue and an urgent problem to be resolved. CO2 is One of the contributors to global warming. The operation of fossil energy generation produces CO2 significantly. This paper examines the use of land for renewable energy power plant and the impact. The operation of 648 MW renewable energy power plants can reduce CO2 emissions by 94.78% compared to the coal-fired power plants at the same capacity. However, the construction of renewable energy plants requires a much larger area, which is 44.89 to 78.51 times the land requirement for coal-fired power plants. So, land clearing for renewable energy power plants will result in a much larger loss of land absorption for CO2 emissions compared to coal-fired power plants. The use of plantation land can reduce CO2 emissions due to the total operation and clearing of land of 4,444,907.97 tons/year up to 4,452,016.56 tons/year compared to the construction of the coal-fired power plant, at the same capacity.

Evolutionary computing approach to optimize superframe scheduling on industrial wireless sensor networks,"[{""Penulis"":""Satrya, Gandeva Bayu""},{""Penulis"":""Shin, Soo Young""}]","The industrial wireless sensor domain has undergone a shift in paradigm as a consequence of Internet of Things (IoT), a thriving technology that has been leading the way in short-range and fixed wireless sensing. One of the problems associated with industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) is finding the optimal solution for minimizing defect time in superframe scheduling. This paper proposed a method based on the use of evolutionary algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), orthogonal learning PSO, genetic algorithm (GA), and modified GA for optimizing the superframe scheduling. Additionally, we evaluated a contemporary method, deadline monotonic scheduling, on the ISA 100.11a protocol. The use of this standard as a case study means that the presented 72 simulations are object-oriented, with numerous variations in the number of timeslots and wireless sensor nodes.

CNC has been shown in multiple scientific studies to be a biodegradable and non-toxic material. However, CNC's sensitivity to humid environments and lack of thermostability has proven to be a key obstacle to its adoption in various industries, including food packaging. In this study, PVA/CNC bio-nanocomposite films at various CNC contents (2–6 wt%) were prepared by solvent casting method, and their properties were characterized by Optical Microscopy (OM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Ultra-visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometer. It was found that the addition of (2-6 wt%) of CNC within PVA improved the interfacial interactions between CNC and the blend to provide a clear micro-structure which was investigated through OM and FESEM. Additionally, the bio-nanocomposite films maintained high transparency level (transmittance of ∼90 % in the visible region in UV–vis), suggesting that the CNC were dispersed well within the PVA matrix. As a result, these superior eco-friendly structured bio-nanocomposites are likely to be effective in food packaging applications. © 2022","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Pulmonary crackles of discontinuous short duration appear on inspiration, expiration, or both. To differentiate these pulmonary crackles, the medical staff usually uses a manual method, called auscultation. Various methods were developed to recognize pulmonary crackles and distinguish them from normal pulmonary sounds to be applied in digital signal processing technology. This paper demonstrates a feature extraction method to classify pulmonary crackle and normal lung sounds using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method using several kernels by performing spectrograms of the pulmonary sound to generate the frequency profile. Spectrograms with various resolutions and 3-fold cross-validation were used to divide the training data and the test data in the testing process. The resulting accuracy ranges from 81.4%-100%. More accuracy values of 100% are generated by a feature extraction in several SVM kernels using 256 points FFT with three variations of windowing parameters compared to 512 points, where the best accuracy of 100% was produced by STFT-SVM method. This method has a potential to be used in the classification of other biomedical signals. The advantages of that are that the number of features produced is the same as the N-point FFT used for any signal length, the flexibility in the STFT parameters changes, such as the type of window and the window's length.

A comparison of text weighting schemes on sentiment analysis of government policies: a case study of replacement of national examinations,"[{""Penulis"":""Sutoyo, Edi""},{""Penulis"":""Rifai, Achmad Pratama""},{""Penulis"":""Risnumawan, Anhar""},{""Penulis"":""Saputra, Muhardi""}]","The National Examination (UN) is a system of evaluation of education standards for elementary and secondary schools conducted nationally and is also used to equalize the quality between education levels. The national examination aims to determine graduation, national education quality mapping, and also for selection to higher education levels. Over the years the UN has become a benchmark for the standardization of education in Indonesia, meaning that the UN is very much needed to find out the size of the quality of student education and the quality of teaching of a school. The government’s policy regarding the plan to remove the UN system has received public attention. The removal of the UN is planned to be replaced with a competency assessment and character survey. In order to know the public’s sentiments regarding this policy, research needs to be done, one of which is to analyze public sentiment through social media Twitter. In text mining tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis, careful selection of a term weighting scheme (TWS) can have a significant impact on effectiveness. We tested the effectiveness of six classification algorithms by varying the TWS in the dataset obtained from Twitter. The experimental results showed that overall TF-IGM outperformed TF-IDF on four classification algorithms. Finally, the sentiment analysis of the discourse on the removal of the UN is expected to provide a general picture to the government regarding public opinion from the point of view of data coming from social media. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

This step involved the development of a newly installed and simple control system to manage the telescope movement with relatively good pointing accuracy. The control system was designed using a programmable logic controller (PLC) that is robust and affordable. Based on the performance testing, this control system achieved average accuracies of 0.95 and 1.083 arcmin in azimuth and elevation positioning respectively, and an RMS of 9 arcmin across the open sky. In addition, it reached average rotation speeds of about 5.4, 2.4, and 4.8 arcmin/s for azimuth, elevation, and tracking rate, respectively. The results also showed that the converted radio telescope has an acceptable tracking accuracy of errors below 10% of the antenna half-power bandwidth at a frequency of 1.4 GHz while generating movement speed suitable for basic radio astronomy observations. These results show that this converted small radio telescope has the basic requirements for tracking and imaging celestial radio objects, primarily via interferometry with larger radio telescopes at low observation frequencies. © 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Design of Data Interchange Regulation for Regional ICT Office,"[{""Penulis"":""Falahah""},{""Penulis"":""Santoso, Ari Fajar""}]","— The rapid development of e-government systems raises issues of the importance of data integration and interoperability. Recently, most government offices provide data interchange services through web services or using database direct-link (db-link), and the process usually runs without referring to certain regulations, standards, or procedures. It can cause some problems such as lack of a standard for data interchange services, lack of procedure for building, deploying, and monitoring the services, duplicate services, problems in tracing and maintaining the services, and much more. The research aims to provide the practical method for designing the regulation for supporting data interchange and propose a draft of the regulation package that consists of policy, procedure, and technical guide. The research is located in a regional ICT government office and the process for designing the regulation is building through a design thinking approach. Outputs of this research are the conceptual map of the issues that should be covered by the regulation, the structure of the policy, the draft of standard and procedure for supporting data interchange mechanism, and the sample of the technical guide. The draft of the regulation is then tested against the actual problem to see how the regulation, procedure, and guide can resolve it.

However, RESs have many limitations like their intermittent nature and availability at far-off sites from the major load centers. This paper presents the forecasting of wind speed and power using the implementation of the Feedforward and cascaded forward neural networks (FFNNs and CFNNs, respectively). The one and half year’s dataset for Jhimpir, Pakistan, is used to train FFNNs and CFNNs with recently developed novel metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a Bat algorithm (BA) named HPSOBA, along with a modified hybrid PSO and BA with parameter-inspired acceleration coefficients (MHPSO-BAAC), without and with the constriction factor (MHPSO-BAAC-χ). The forecasting results are made for June–October 2019. The accuracy of the forecasted values is tested through the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The graphical and numerical comparative analysis was performed for both feedforward and cascaded forward neural networks that are tuned using the mentioned optimization techniques. The feedforward neural network was achieved through the implementation of HPSOBA with a mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error of 0.0673, 6.73%, and 0.0378, respectively. Whereas for the case of forecasting through a cascaded forward neural network, the best performance was attained by the implementation of MHPSO-BAAC with a MAE, MAPE and RMSE of 0.0112, 1.12%, and 0.0577, respectively. Thus, the mentioned neural networks provide a more accurate prediction when trained and tuned through the given optimization algorithms, which is evident from the presented results. © 2022 by the authors.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Of course, this global issue cannot be separated from the issue of emissions. Various methods to solve generator scheduling problems by considering emissions or Economic Emission Dispatch (EED) have been published, but not to the extent of calculating the cost to reduce emissions. The main objective of this research is to determine the cost of reducing the emission of electricity generation in Indonesia through solving the EED problem. The method proposed to solve the EED problem is an annealing simulation algorithm and tested using an electrical system of eight generators, four different loads, and five combinations of cost and emission weights. This method is tested with various loads (conditions), and each condition is tested with various combinations of cost weights and emission weights. The obtained results were compared with the results of the calculation of the Cuckoo algorithm, and the whale optimization algorithm. The simulation results show that it costs US$258.81 to reduce 1 ton of emissions.

The specific challenges in developing detect defectors involve the vagueness and tiny size of defects. To solve these problems, we propose incorporating super‐resolution technique, sequential feature pyramid network, and boundary localization. Initially, the ensemble of enhanced super‐resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN) was proposed for the preprocessing stage to generate a more detailed contour of the original steel image. Next, in the detector section, the latest state‐of-the‐art feature pyramid network, known as De‐tectoRS, utilized the recursive feature pyramid network technique to extract deeper multi‐scale steel features by learning the feedback from the sequential feature pyramid network. Finally, Side‐Aware Boundary Localization was used to precisely generate the output prediction of the defect detectors. We named our approach EnsGAN‐ SDD. Extensive experimental studies showed that the proposed methods improved the defect detector’s performance, which also surpassed the accuracy of state‐of‐the‐art methods. Moreover, the proposed EnsGAN achieved better performance and effectiveness in processing time compared with the original ESRGAN.

A way to reduce the impact of this problem is to detect the presence of cancer early on. For detecting the presence of cancer in the bones, we must perform a whole-body bone scan and segment it afterward. In many studies about whole-body bone scan images segmentation, the data usually comes from one source. Therefore, data scarcity problems may occur. The idea of using different sources may have an impact since there are size differences in bone geometry between different ethnicities. In this study, a system that can segment whole-body bone scan images automatically is proposed. The system is designed by using the Btrfly-Net method. Furthermore, the impact of using cross-domain dataset and augmentation methods is observed. The result shows that the system can segment bone scan with 0.856 and 0.780 dice coefficient score using the Btrfly-Net and U-Net methods, respectively. Moreover, augmentation method could increase the Btrfly-Net system metric over 1% while decreasing U-Net system metric over 2-6%. The decreasing metric occurrence in the U-Net system is not caused by the augmentation method directly. Furthermore, there are metric differences in using cross-domain dataset over 3-6%.

Besides the high COD and BOD values, the laboratory wastewater also contains metals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) which is categorized as dangerous waste material and can pollute the groundwater. Although the quantity of wastewater produced by the laboratory is relatively small, it has a real impact on the environment around the laboratory. However, the wastewater has to be treated properly before being discharged into the environment. The aim of the research was to study the laboratory wastewater treatment by using Fenton’s reagent with coagulation and adsorption pretreatment. In the pretreatment with coagulation, three types of coagulants are used, namely PAC (Poly Aluminum Chloride), ACH (Aluminum Chlorohydrate) and Aluminum Sulfate (AS) with their respective concentrations of 10–80 ppm. The highest percentage of average pollutant removal of 58.21% was found when 80 ppm of AS was applied. The pretreatment was continued by adsorption with activated carbon and zeolite adsorbents within 60–120 minutes of mixing time.

A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model with Word-Emoji Embedding for Improving the Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Indonesia's PPKM Policy,"[{""Penulis"":""Pane, Syafrial Fachri""},{""Penulis"":""Ramdan, Jenly""},{""Penulis"":""Putrada, Aji Gautama""},{""Penulis"":""Fauzan, Mohamad Nurkamal""},{""Penulis"":""Awangga, Rolly Maulana""},{""Penulis"":""Alamsyah, Nur""}]","The policy of limiting community mobilization is implemented to reduce the daily rate of COVID-19. However, a high-accuracy sentiment analysis model can determine public sentiment toward such policies. Our research aims to improve the accuracy of the LSTM model on sentiment analysis of the Jakarta community towards PPKM using Indonesian language Tweets with emoji embedding. The first stage is modeling using the hybrid CNN-LSTM model. It is a combination between CNN and LSTM. The CNN model cites word embedding and emoji embedding features that reflect the dependence on temporary short-term sentiment. At the same time, LSTM builds long-term sentiment relationships between words and emojis. Next, the model evaluation uses Accuracy, Loss, the receiver operating curve (ROC), the precision and recall curve, and the area under curve (AUC) value to see the performance of the designed model. Based on the results of the tests, we conclude that the CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model performs better with the words+emoji dataset.

Compressive sensing (CS), as a method with a statistical approach in signal sampling, provides different output patterns based on information sources. Thus, it can be considered that CS can be used for feature extraction of compressed information. Methods: In this study, we proposed a novel texture extraction-based CS for lung cancer classification. We classify three types of lung cancer, including adenocarcinoma (ACA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and benign lung cancer (N). The classification is carried out based on texture extraction, which is processed in 2 stages, the first stage to detect N and the second to detect ACA and SCC. Results: The simulation results show that two-stage texture extraction can improve accuracy by an average of 84%. The proposed system is expected to be decision support in assisting clinical diagnosis. In terms of technical storage, this system can save memory resources. Conclusions: The proposed two-step texture extraction system combined with CS and K- Nearest Neighbor has succeeded in classifying lung cancer with high accuracy; the system can also save memory storage.

Lecturer-Course Assignment Model in National Joint Courses Program to Improve Education Quality and Lecturers’ Time Preference,"[{""Penulis"":""Kusuma, Purba Daru""},{""Penulis"":""Adiputra, Dimas""}]","One critical problem in Indonesia's national joint courses program, initiated by the ministry of education and culture of Indonesia, is the lecturer-course assignment problem. Although the lecturer-course assignmentproblem has been studied widely as part of the education timetabling problem, no existing lecturer-courseassignment model suits this circumstance. The new cases in this program are as follows. First, this program isconducted online. Second, the participants are students and lecturers from different universities. Based on thisproblem, this work proposes a novel lecturer-course assignment model that suits this program. The lecturers'preferred courses and timeslots become hard constraints. The model has three objectives: (1) maximizing theeducational quality, (2) maximizing the lecturers' time preference, and (3) minimizing the number of unservedclasses. This model is developed by using integer linear programming and optimized by using cloud theory-basedsimulated annealing. This proposed model is then compared with the four previous lecturers-course assignmentmodels. The first model concerns about minimizing the number of unserved classes, while the second model focuseson maximizing the education quality. The maximum number of classes per course for every lecturer is considered inthe third model while balancing the lecturer’s load (teach, research, community service) is the feature of the fourthmodel. The research concludes that the proposed model is appropriate for lecture-course assignment in Indonesia’snational joint courses program compared to the previous models.

With the support of this technology, it can help the work of health workers in dealing with their patients. Not only acting as a curative and rehabilitative, but technology can also be used as a preventive medium for dangerous diseases; an example is a stroke. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability. Stroke can occur due to lifestyle factors (such as tobacco and alcohol use) and medical factors (such as a history of heart disease and hypertension). Data on patients who have factors that trigger stroke can be used to detect and predict the potential for the patient to have a stroke or not. The research was conducted using a Deep Learning algorithm, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to train the data to produce an architecture that can predict the possibility of brain stroke. The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Brain Stroke Detection public domain dataset, which has 11 attributes (including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and stroke). The architecture produced an excellent accuracy of 98%, an F1-Score of 98%, and a Loss of 0.1180. Besides, this architecture has a good fitting, which shows that the architecture made is robust enough to predict the potential for the occurrence of brain stroke.  © 2022 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Organizational Resistance to Technology Diffusion: The Case of IPv6,"[{""Penulis"":""Syamsuar, Dedy""},{""Penulis"":""Dell, Peter""},{""Penulis"":""Witarsyah, Deden""},{""Penulis"":""Luthfi, Ahmad""}]","IP address is an essential protocol to identify every connected device to the Internet uniquely. IPv6 was developed as a longterm solution to overcome IPv4's shortcomings. However, IPv6 adoption is still very rare. Organizations tend to resistance to adopting and implementing IPv6 on their network. This study aims to develop and test a model of organizational resistance to IPv6, an Internet Protocol (IP) intended to replace IPv4, the widely used incumbent. This exploratory mixed-methods study analyzed interview data from Indonesian organizations, supplemented with insights from prior literature, to identify factors of organizational resistance to IPv6. A subsequent survey of Indonesian organizations was conducted to assess the relationship of each factor with IPv6 resistance. The survey data was then rigorously analyzed using PLS-SEM. While IPv6 is typically portrayed as an essential Internet infrastructure development, Indonesian organizations perceive it as unnecessary and threatening. A Structural Equation Model of IPv6 Resistance was developed and posits that although perceived threat, perceived lack of need, and environmental influences all influence organizational resistance to IPv6, switching costs and satisfaction with current technology have no impact. This study has practical implications for organizations that aim to promote IPv6 diffusion; promotion strategies should address the key factors identified in this study. While prior models of technology resistance have focused on individual-level resistance to technologies promoted from within the organization, this study focuses on organizational-level resistance to technology promoted by sources external to the organization and hence makes a new theoretical contribution. © 2022, International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology.

The PCE of the photovoltaic cells is primarily related to the architecture of the cells, as well as the electrodes and electrolyte employed. Using zinc oxide (ZnO) coupled with two-dimensional graphene as photoelectrode enables efficient charge transfer and minimizes electron–hole recombination in the DSSCs, resulting in improved performance. This review outlines the feasibility and performance enhancement of ZnO/graphene nanocomposite and its derivatives as photoelectrode for DSSCs. The structural features, optical properties, electron transport, and dye interaction of the ZnO/graphene nanocomposite-based photoelectrode were considered in this review. In addition, the limitations of ZnO/graphene derivatives as photoelectrodes and their solutions were extensively discussed, as well as their prospects.

Drowsiness Detection System for Masked Face Based on Deep Neural Network and Haar Cascade,"[{""Penulis"":""Pratama, Eryl Nanda""},{""Penulis"":""Al Maki, Wikky Fawwaz""}]","Nowadays, technology is growing rapidly followed by modernization. Face detection technology is one technology that has been developed and applied in various sectors such as biometrics recognition systems, retrieval systems, database indexing in digital video, security systems with restricted area access control, video conferencing, and human interaction systems. Eye detection is a further development of face detection in which the image of a human face was detected to be processed by detecting the location of both eyes on the face. Nowadays, the eye detection system can be used as a means of developing more complex applications and can be applied directly in the aspect of technology that uses eye detection like, eye state detection system, drowsiness and fatigue detection system, safety driving support systems or driver assistance system. In this study we propose drowsiness detection system utilizing current novel classification model such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), combined with Haar Cascade. The DNN is utilized to detect face, while Haar Cascade is utilized for detecting the eyes and its state on the detected face. In this study, due to Covid19 pandemic, we focused on developing the classifiers for detecting the face with mask. Apart from that, our proposed classifiers are also capable of identifying non-masked faces.

For this purpose, quarterly time series data ranging from 2009 to 2018 were used. In short run, results failed to establish causality from Chinese Foreign Direct Investment to Economic Growth, while a unidirectional causality was found from economic growth to Chinese Foreign Direct Investment. However, results of this study confirm that the variables of interest are bound together in the long run only when Chinese Foreign Direct Investment is the dependent variable, indicating that enhanced economic growth attracts more Foreign Direct Investment in Pakistan. Results of this study have important implications for economists and policymakers to make policies alongside China Pakistan Economic Corridor in order to ensure that the potential spillovers from the inflow of Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in the shape of China Pakistan Economic Corridor infrastructure projects create domestic spillover. Moreover, the insignificant effect of Chinese Foreign Direct Investment on the economic growth of Pakistan in the short run is due to the real challenges that Pakistan faces due to access to credit and state capacity to sustain economic growth.

In general, the identity storage system is designed with a centralized system and managed by each government agency. However, this system has some disadvantages, like data replication and redundancy. Furthermore, the Indonesian government is now undertaking a program through the Ministry of Home Affairs to use population data for public services by providing access to organizations cooperating for population data use. With a centralized database managed by a single entity, data abuse can occur and rely on third parties, the sole authority of the national identity data. The blockchain-based solution described in this paper to integrate a national identity system can provide the advantages of a population data utilization program. The system designed can facilitate convenience in sharing and updating population data while also ensuring the security and integrity of the population data. The citizens do not have to worry about the possibility of data misuse by user institutions. Blockchain technology offers decentralization through the participation of members across a distributed network. There is no single point of failure, and no single user may alter the transaction record.

It can be seen in the increase in people's consumption patterns from trading through physical stores (offline) to trading through electronic systems, often referred to as e-commerce. Logistics services are distribution actors in the downstream line which are tasked with delivering products from the fulfillment center from e-commerce to the end customer. The uncertainty of the number of requests is the biggest challenge for logistics service players. The growth of e-commerce has also led to an increase in sales volume in e-commerce which has given rise to a new generation of warehouses that are specifically tailored to the special needs of online retailers who directly serve the demands of end-customers in the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment. Traditional warehousing systems cannot handle orders with the characteristics of many transactions but smaller sizes. In addition, warehouses that handle e-commerce are also required to have a fast process in the warehouse because shipments must be made on the same day. In this study, the author aims to perform calculations to find the optimal order picking time in the warehouse, so orders in e-commerce can be processed faster by comparing the picking process time using ordinary Single Picker Routing Problem (SPRP) and combined with the concept of wave picking using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Based on a theoretical study in this paper, the combination between SPRP and wave picking can reduce 42.28% picking time. © 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Our findings suggest that companies with lower governance mechanisms and looser institutional backgrounds are more likely to find that IFRS implementation may provide less room for management to maximize their short-term gain by manipulating earnings. Nevertheless, we do not find a similar pattern among the firms with low corruption culture.

Breakthrough in Achieving Energy Mix Target in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Raharjo, Jangkung""},{""Penulis"":""Rahmat, Basuki""},{""Penulis"":""Hasudungan, Jaspar""},{""Penulis"":""Adam, Kharisma Bani""}]","The energy crisis is a global issue, apart from global warming, encouraging countries to use renewable energy sources. Likewise, Indonesia, a country with a large population and huge potential for renewable energy sources, has a target of using renewable energy of 23% in the energy mix in 2025 and 31% in 2050. This study compares the predictions of installed capacity and energy mix using simple linear regression and compares it with the energy mix target set by the Government so that the percentage deviation is known. Based on the linear regression method calculation in 2025, the percentage of renewable energy in the energy mix only reaches 13.76%. However, several breakthroughs have been made, including the issuance of several government policies that encourage the achievement of these targets and mandate local governments to realize the potential of their respective regions. Meanwhile, the results of the SLR in 2050 are very close to the energy mix target set by the Government, namely 97.87 percent for installed capacity and 96.88 percent for the capacity of renewable energy sources. It could be because the Government still has enough time to implement the plans that have been drawn up.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The prefrontal cortex is a structure in the brain that is located in the frontal lobe. Accurate detection or diagnosis becomes important for therapeutic management because, it is difficult to identify at an early stage. Therefore, in this study, an analysis of differences in brain activation in healthy elderly (non-stroke) and post-stroke patients with vascular dementia was conducted when performing memory recall work. This study involved seven elderly non-stroke and seven stroke patients with vascular dementia. Brain activity was recorded using a 19-channel clinical electroencephalogram (EEG).

Developing Radioactive Medical Waste Management System of Nuclear Medicine Units Using Open-Source Enterprise Resource Planning: Case Study in Indonesian Public Hospital,"[{""Penulis"":""Paramita""},{""Penulis"":""Ridwan, Ari Yanuar""},{""Penulis"":""Septiningrum, Lutfia""}]","With its growth in all current technological paths, public health institutions in Indonesia show the path of existence and services in the eyes of the public. By improving its services was like providing radiation energy technology treatment from nuclear nuclei. Of course, this will produce radioactive waste from medical treatment, which needs to be treated properly. Most hospitals still use manual systems to manage the radioactive waste ranging from collecting the data to reporting. This can lead to several problems such as human error, data loss, data duplication, and others, especially for radioactive medical waste. Radioactive medical waste is quite dangerous if not properly monitored and can potentially pose a risk of disease transmission, health problems and environmental pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to manage medical waste properly with the help of an integrated information system. This research will design a radioactive medical waste management system module based on ERP with open-source Odoo using the Quickstart method. With ERP, it will help monitor the management of radioactive medical waste that can be integrated with the relevant hospital elements.

A new nearest neighbor-based framework for diabetes detection,"[{""Penulis"":""Suyanto, Suyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Meliana, Selly""},{""Penulis"":""Wahyuningrum, Tenia""},{""Penulis"":""Khomsah, Siti""}]","Diabetes is one of the deadliest and costliest diseases. Today, automatic diabetes detection systems are primarily developed using deep learning (DL) approaches, which give high accuracy in classifying patients into two classes: have diabetes or not. Unfortunately, DL is a high-complexity and unexplainable black-box model. This paper proposes a new nearest neighbor-based framework to tackle those issues in classifying two diabetes datasets: binary-class Pima India Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and multiclass Diabetes Type. A k-means clustering (KMC) is first carried out to remove the noises or outliers and keep the competent data in the training set. The dimension of the competent data is then reduced using an autoencoder (AE) to minimize the distances of the intra-class data but maximize that of the inter-class. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and two variants: pseudo nearest neighbor rule (PNNR) and local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN), are used to detect diabetes. In addition, a new variant named multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is introduced. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation (FCV) informs that, for binary-class PIDD, the proposed combination of KMC, AE, and MVMCNN achieves the highest accuracy of 99.13%, which is slightly higher than the state-of-the-art DL-based detection model that produces 98.07%. An evaluation based on 10-FCV also indicates that, for the multiclass Diabetes Type, it obtains a higher accuracy of 95.24% than the DL-based model for predicting diabetes that gives 94.02%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The number of internet users in Indonesia reached 205 million in January 2022. This data means that 73.7% of Indonesia's population has used the internet. The median internet speed for mobile phones in Indonesia is 15.82 Mbps, while the median internet connection speed for Wi-Fi in Indonesia is 20.13 Mbps. As predicted by many, real-time traffic such as multimedia streaming dominates more than 79% of traffic on the internet network. This condition will be a severe challenge for the internet network, which is required to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for user mobility, such as reducing delay, data loss, and network costs. However, IP-based networks are no longer efficient at managing traffic. Named Data Network (NDN) is a promising technology for building an agile communication model that reduces delays through a distributed and adaptive name-based data delivery approach. NDN replaces the 'where' paradigm with the concept of 'what'. User requests are no longer directed to a specific IP address but to specific content. This paradigm causes responses to content requests to be served by a specific server and can also be served by the closest device to the requested data. NDN router has CS to cache the data, significantly reducing delays and improving the internet network's quality of Service (QoS). Motivated by this, in 2019, we began intensive research to achieve a national flagship product, an NDN router with different functions from ordinary IP routers. NDN routers have cache, forwarding, and routing functions that affect data security on name-based networks. Designing scalable NDN routers is a new challenge as NDN requires fast hierarchical name-based lookups, perpackage data field state updates, and large-scale forward tables. We have a research team that has conducted NDN research through simulation, emulation, and testbed approaches using virtual machines to get the best NDN router design before building a prototype. Research results from 2019 show that the performance of NDN-based networks is better than existing IP-based networks. The tests were carried out based on various scenarios on the Indonesian network topology using NDNsimulator, MATLAB, Mininet-NDN, and testbed using virtual machines. Various network performance parameters, such as delay, throughput, packet loss, resource utilization, header overhead, packet transmission, round trip time, and cache hit ratio, showed the best results compared to IP-based networks. In addition, NDN Testbed based on open source is free, and the flexibility of creating topology has also been successfully carried out. This testbed includes all the functions needed to run an NDN network. The resource capacity on the server used for this testbed is sufficient to run a reasonably complex topology. However, bugs are still found on the testbed, and some features still need improvement. The following exploration of the NDN testbed will run with more new strategy algorithms and add Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the NDN function. Using AI in cache and forwarding strategies can make the system more intelligent and precise in making decisions according to network conditions. It will be a step toward developing NDN router products by the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) Indonesia.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

RKUPH Approval Service System Design Using SCSE Framework,"[{""Penulis"":""Rinaldy, Dicky""},{""Penulis"":""Suhardi""},{""Penulis"":""Muhamad, Wardani""}]","The existence of IT services in supporting business processes is a must in today's modern organizations. The main goal to be achieved is to maintain the existence of the organization in accordance with the times. In practice, the development of IT services is highly dependent on the availability of human resources who have competence in software development. However, this limitation can be overcome by involving external parties (external outsourcing) as software developers. However, this approach has a weakness if the organization's service needs are not well defined, so it will be difficult for external parties who do not understand the organization's business processes; it has the potential to cause differences in specifications and development results. The PUPH Directorate has the same problem in realizing the transformation of forest management i.e., changing the RKUPH approval service from conventional to IT-based. To fulfill this, the PUPH Directorate must provide IT service design documents to develop IT services. Therefore, this study aims to design an IT service system that can then be used as a guide for application development by external parties. The SCSE framework was chosen as a guide in designing IT service systems. The resulting design evaluated against four SOA principles: coupling, cohesion, usability, and complexity. Based on the evaluation results, the values of the four principles are 0.009, 0.924, 0.010, and 3,000. It indicates that the resulting design are loosely coupling and high cohesion. Furthermore, adding web mockup activities and optimizing service blueprint activities in the SCSE framework makes it easier for organizations to develop business and IT service designs that align with organizational goals and strategies. In addition, the resulting design is easily understood by external parties so that the service system design that has been made becomes a control card for the development of IT services by external parties.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

Due to various issues like gender discrimination, women's self-sustainability is quite low, and this accounts for the negligible contribution of women in Pakistan's economy (up to 20 to 25%). In addressing this issue, the current study adopted a quantitative research approach and cross-sectional research design. By using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from female clients of microfinance institutions during May 1, 2018 to August 30, 2018. SmartPLS 3 was utilized to analyse the data. The results of the inquiry revealed that microfinance institutions have an essential role to play in promoting women's self-reliance. With the help of micro-enterprises for women, services offered by microfinance institution such as micro-credit, micro-savings, micro-insurance, micro-training and social capital have a major role in developing women's self-sustainability. However, an environmental disaster is one of the crucial factors, which limits the positive contribution of microfinance institutions towards women's self-sustainability. Our thorough research and knowledge on the subject indicates that the current study is the pioneer study that has investigated microfinance institutions as major facilitators of women's self-reliance but which has been limited by many factors such as environmental disasters.

As historical building conservation began to decline, many historical buildings are being abandoned and converted into modern facilities in response to our changing needs. The conservation attempt can be made simple by utilizing the Building Information Modeling (BIM), and High Definition Survey (HDS) approaches. These technologies are considered brand new in managing important information related to 3D models, providing us with semantic information and accurate information in both position and elevation. HDS data is constructed in the form of point clouds generated by the collaboration of survey equipment such as GNSS, Drones, Terrestrial Laser Scanning, and high-performance computers. Point cloud data is registered, filtered, and georeferenced before using BIM modeling. This study resulted from registering point cloud data with RMSE 3mm and customary semantic information. The BIM model based on accurate point cloud data is expected to be a solution and a reference in carrying out the conservation and reconstruction of historical buildings in the future.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

This is caused due to a lack of public awareness of this disease. Histopathological examination is one of the methods of detecting breast cancer which is performed manually by a pathologist. However, the diagnostic process of histopathological examination takes a long time and allows a shift in diagnosis. Therefore, technologies are needed to help pathologists to get a diagnosis quickly and accurately. One of them is deep learning. In this research, the deep learning-based system model was developed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNet architecture to help radiologists to get better accuracy and performance in detecting breast cancer. The system performance was tested on 1361 histopathology images consisting of two classes, which are normal and cancer with data ratios for train, validation, and test are 75%, 10%, and 15%. By using the proposed method, the system is able to classify images with the best accuracy rate of 94.26%, loss of 39.52%, precision of 94%, and recall of 94%.

Data from South East Asian Medical Information Center (SEAMIC) explain that the most significant stroke mortality occurred in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, and Thailand. There are several methods for diagnosing stroke, one of which is an electroencephalograph (EEG). EEG is one of the more widely used BCI methods due to its lower price, portability, ease of use, and high temporal resolution than other methods. Most EEG require signals from various places on the scalp to achieve good performance. However, using a large number of channels can degrade signal performance in the EEG. Spatial selection can be used for channel selection in the EEG stroke signal which can then be useful for evaluation of stroke therapy. Therefore, this study will select the optimized channel using the spatial selection method to see which channels are relevant to the EEG stroke signal. Also, using the Power Spectral Density extraction feature and Extreme Learning Machine classification. The L2-norm energy calculation method gets better results than other methods. This method can also select the active channel relevant to the stroke EEG signal. The results show that the spatial selection method can increase accuracy by 15 percent and optimize the system with 37.5 percent channel reductions.  © 2022 IEEE.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Consequently, it adds to the complexity of the last-mile delivery process. Moreover, this process often contributes significantly to the distribution cost of companies. An alternative to alleviate the problem is the utilization of parcel lockers. It allows the delivery to be extended not only for home delivery but also for locker delivery, which brings several advantages in terms of cost-saving. However, considering multiple delivery options means adding new complexity to the delivery system. In the previous works, vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) has been widely dealt by only considering home delivery. This research proposes a new VRPTW variant by adding locker delivery as one of the delivery options. The developed problem is called the vehicle routing problem with parcel lockers (VRPPL). The goal of VRPPL is to minimize the total traveling cost. In this research, we formulate a new mathematical programming model and develop a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to deal with VRPPL.

Tsunami Potential Prediction using Seismic Features and Artificial Neural Network for Tsunami Early Warning System,"[{""Penulis"":""Novianty, Astri""},{""Penulis"":""Machbub, Carmadi""},{""Penulis"":""Widiyantoro, Sri""},{""Penulis"":""Meilano, Irwan""},{""Penulis"":""Daryono""}]","Tsunamis are categorized as geophysical disasters because tectonic earthquakes triggered most of their occurrences. The high number of deaths due to tsunami catastrophe has made many countries develop a tsunami early warning system (TEWS), especially countries prone to tectonic earthquakes. One of the crucial subsystems in a TEWS is the tsunami potential prediction subsystem. To provide an early warning of tsunami, the prediction must be carried out based on early observation of the seismic event before the tsunami. In this short time of computation, the calculation of seismic parameters can only produce some roughly estimated features. Hence, a proper inference method that can decide accurate predictions upon the features is urgently needed for the TEWS. Some existing TEWSs are using rule-based inference to decide the prediction and often overestimate the prediction of tsunami potential. This study tries to develop a tsunami-potential prediction system using the machine learning approach as its inference method. Seismic features extracted from P-wave seismic signals are used as input data for learning and classification using a backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN). The accuracy result is then validated by K-fold cross-validation. Our simulation results show that the utilization of backpropagation ANN has given better accuracy in tsunami prediction compared to one of the existing TEWS that does not use machine learning for its prediction. At least for some seismic events that occurred during 2010-2017, the proposed system results in fewer overestimated predictions than the existing TEWS referred. © 2022,International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology.

On the utilization of RDCA method for detecting and predicting the occurrence of heavy rainfall in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Harjupa W.""},{""Penulis"":""Abdillah M.R.""},{""Penulis"":""Azura A.""},{""Penulis"":""Putranto M.F.""},{""Penulis"":""Marzuki M.""},{""Penulis"":""Nauval F.""},{""Penulis"":""Risyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Saufina E.""},{""Penulis"":""Jumianti N.""},{""Penulis"":""Fathrio I.""}]","Accurate prediction of heavy rainfall events is crucial to mitigate hydrometeorological disasters. The real-time cloud observation by weather satellites Himawari-8 has enabled researchers to develop a nowcasting method (short-term prediction) to identify rainfall events in advance, namely the Rapidly Developing Cumulus Area (RDCA) method. The RDCA index, which is the product of the RDCA method, is the probability of occurrence of heavy rainfall. It has been evaluated and successfully utilized in Japan. However, the performance of the RDCA in the tropics has not been assessed yet. Indonesia —as a tropical country consisting of abundant islands— exhibits distinct climate and convective systems due to its geographical characteristics. Different temporal resolution of Himawari-8 data between Japan region (2.5 min) and the tropics (10 min) may also result in different RDCA performance. Therefore, it is important to conduct an evaluation study before operating the RDCA in Indonesia. By performing spatial comparison and using dichotomous and probabilistic verifications with rain gauges at various thresholds, this study finds that the RDCA is able to detect and predict rainfall events in Indonesia. The best lead time is 10 min but the predictive signals extend up to 30 min in advance; it is shorter than that observed in Japan. Lighter rainfall has higher predictability compared with heavier rainfall. The predicted heavy rainfall events show good accuracy, probability of detection, and brier score. The RDCA index and rainfall intensity appear to have a good correlation, where light (heavy) rainfall is better predicted by low (high) RDCA indices. It confirms the usefulness of varying RDCA index in contrast to the classic dichotomous RDCA index. This study reveals the positive prospects of RDCA in Indonesia. We also discuss some future challenges and give possible recommendations regarding an operational RDCA system. This study will benefit the development of early warning systems in Indonesia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Relationship among family, work engagement, and turnover intention form J-DR perspective: exploring family’s dual role as source of conflict and support","[{""Penulis"":""Winarno, Alex""},{""Penulis"":""Kisahwan, Daniel""},{""Penulis"":""Hermana, Deni""}]","Family serves as a job resource that can improve employees’ work engagement. However, increased work engagement can potentially trigger work-family conflict and lead to employees’ withdrawal, even employees turnover. It is necessary to explore family functions to fill the existing theoretical and practical gap. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze the relationship among family, work engagement, and turnover intention by considering the family as a sources source of both conflict and support. To this end, this study surveyed non-manager and staff-level employees in pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia. Analyzed using SEM covariance procedure with AMOS 23 software, this study found that family plays dual roles in affecting employees’ work engagement. Increased work engagement was found to result in a lower turnover intention yet increasing work-family conflict. Increased sales, working hours, and targets are among the factors leading to work-family conflict. Work engagement is a double-edged sword that should be handled carefully through communication and stress management interventions. Activities like family gathering programs are also recommended to minimize work-family conflict and improve family support.

The Communication Flow in the Protection of Indonesian Female Migrant Workers through the Migrant Worker Family Community (KKBM),"[{""Penulis"":""Juddi, Moh Faidol""},{""Penulis"":""Perbawasari, Susie""},{""Penulis"":""Zubair, Feliza""}]","The purpose of this study aimed to explain the flow of communication in Indonesian female migrant workers’ protection by the government through the Migrant Worker Family Community (KKBM). The method used in this study was qualitative with a case study approach. The existence of Indonesian female migrant workers has contributed to state revenues of up to US$ 10.97 billion in 2018. This income is higher than the state income of the mining sector. The amount of income provided by female migrant workers to the country is not proportional to the protection services they receive. Most female migrant workers and families preferred to keep the case they face and would report it when it becomes a crisis. Some claims faced by female migrant workers conflict with a employer because of unpaid salaries and inappropriate work. It happens because female migrant workers and families do not know the flow of the case reporting scheme. The pathway for protecting female migrant workers involves a variety of government agencies and private companies. Each institution has its protection program, such as the National Agency for Placement and Protection of Indonesian migrant workers (BNP2TKI), the Ministry of Manpower, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Indonesian Migrant Workers Distribution Company, without explicit coordination between each institution. One of the aspects of protection strategies through the BNP2TKI is to create the Migrant Worker Family Community (KKBM) as a bridge in providing protection services directly to female migrant workers and families. The program is run bottom-up by involving Ex-migrant workers as the driving force (CO); one of them is like in the Cirebon district. Government communication with female migrant workers and families through Cirebon KKBM is carried out in a multi-step flow communication by combining direct communication and media. The KKBM communicated directly to female migrant workers (candidates) and families to socialize programs supported by pamphlets regarding job vacancy, people’s business credit submission procedures, information about the BP2TKI’s regulation, and other supporting information. The results of the assistance are then reported by the provincial government (BP3TKI) via telephone or WhatsApp Group and required meetings. Unfortunately, the KKBM socialization process was hampered by the busy activities of the KKBM activists and the government, which focused on the success of this program on the KKBM’s CO with a minimal budget and supporting facilities… © 2021.

The goal of the smart matrix along with future electric vehicle layouts addresses various challenges related to the platform, suitability and control of the electrical system. After a survey focusing on advanced measurement and matching frameworks, the methodology of electric vehicles in the grid is introduced. Other nifty advances in electric vehicle charging are also extensively analyzed in terms of their potential capabilities, effects and limitations in grid-connected vehicle conditions. In addition, the strong penetration of sustainable energy sources (wind and solar photovoltaic) is creating momentum as part of the force. Their discontinuous performance of force causes many difficulties in the organization, operation and control of force organizations. Again, the placement of electric vehicles in the energy market can compensate for changes in the power grid. In these particular cases, a written assessment of the most recent possible and environmentally friendly energy regulation using electric vehicles with knowledge of promising exploration holes Appointments that need to be concealed will be checked.

Electronic Nose and Neural Network Algorithm for Multiclass Classification of Meat Quality,"[{""Penulis"":""Juannata, Alif Firman""},{""Penulis"":""Wijaya, Dedy Rahman""},{""Penulis"":""Wikusna, Wawa""}]","Meat is a source of food that contains many nutrients. The nutritional content of meat consists of fat, calories, trans fat, saturated fat, calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and magnesium. Due to its good nutritional content, the demand for meat in Indonesia has increased. However, there are problems with meat health. Meat is prone to spoilage and is quickly contaminated with microbes. The microbial population can spoil or spoil the meat. Checking the feasibility of meat is usually done by looking at the texture of the meat traditionally. However, this method is less effective in assessing the feasibility of meat. Therefore, another method is used to determine the feasibility of meat, namely using the Electronic Nose (e-nose) with the Neural Network (NN) algorithm. Because by using an e-nose, that can find out the smell or smell of decent meat. They are applying the NN algorithm for classification to work in a structured manner on each component needed to determine meat quality. These results can help people to get the meat of good quality.

In general, wave height predictions rely heavily on numerical simulations. The computational cost of such a simulation can be very high (and it can be time-consuming), especially when considering a complex coastal area, since these simulations require high-resolution grids. This study utilized a deep learning technique called bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) for wave forecasting to save computing time and to produce accurate predictions. The deep learning method was trained using wave data obtained by a continuous numerical wave simulation using the SWAN wave model over a 20-year period with ECMWF ERA-5 wind data. We utilized highly spatially correlated wind as input for the deep learning method to select the best feature for wave forecasting. We chose an area with a complex geometry as the study case, an area in Indonesia’s Java Sea. We also compared the results of wave prediction using BiLSTM with those of other methods, i.e., LSTM, support vector regression (SVR), and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN).

However, there are obstacles to implementing it, which is shown by the results of program evaluations every year that there is a deficit problem, starting in 2014 until 2019 to and even expected to increase in the following years. One of the possible deficits is due to inefficient patient behavior and referral system which will affect the premium amount. The goal is to evaluate and plan further policies with efficient premiums amount. System dynamics is used to simulate the effects of ability-to-pay, willingness-to-pay, salary, age, health cost each customer, and fund inventory. The historical data are used from INHIS from 2014 to 2019, then projected until 2030. The simulation results show that the health costs considered for determining the premiums are critical to the financial stability. If the premium is not in accordance with the customer’s ability, the government will have to subsidise to avoid deficit.

With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection around the world, disease severity is influenced by the immunological status of the individual, seronegative or seropositive, prior to natural infection. Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype and a period of temporary cross-immunity (TCI) to other serotypes. The clinical response on exposure to a second serotype is complex with the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process, a disease augmentation phenomenon when pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection, used to explain the etiology of severe disease. In this paper, we present a minimalistic mathematical model framework developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated by antibodies. Three models are analyzed and compared: (i) primary dengue infection, (ii) secondary dengue infection with the same (homologous) dengue virus and (iii) secondary dengue infection with a different (heterologous) dengue virus. We explore the features of viral replication, antibody production and infection clearance over time. The model is developed based on body cells and free virus interactions resulting in infected cells activating antibody production. Our mathematical results are qualitatively similar to the ones described in the empiric immunology literature, providing insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe disease.

Protein kinase G is a primary target for treating malaria due to its essential role in Plasmodium falciparum life cycle. In this present study, several computational approaches such as QSAR modelling, molecular docking, and all-atom MD simulation are performed to screen 36 drug candidates against malaria. From QSAR analysis, three potent drugs are selected based on the strong correlation between the inhibitory action, i.e. pEC50 and various descriptors. Further, those selected drugs are used as ligand molecules for molecular docking. We predict three complexes of models 1, 2, and 3 bind to the catalytic site of protein kinase G, suggesting those ligands may become potent inhibitors for Plasmodium falciparum. To validate the structural stability of those complexes, the parameters of RMSD, RMSF, and Rg are calculated from MD simulation. All models are stable along simulation since no significant fluctuations are observed in those validity parameters. Moreover, the binding energy is estimated at each model using MM-GBSA method and model 2 becomes the most stable structure.

Majority of diabetes cases, 90–95%, are of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes which is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes can be detected earlier by using examination that contains diabetes-related parameters. However, the dataset does not always contain complete information, the distribution between positive and negative classes is mostly imbalanced, and some parameters have low importance to the decision class. To overcome the problems, this study needs to carry out preprocessing to improve detection precision and recall. In this paper, propose an approach on dataset preprocessing, which is applied to diabetes prediction. The preprocessing approach consists of the following process: missing value process, imbalanced data process, feature importance process, and data augmentation process. The data preprocessing process uses the median for missing value, random oversampling for imbalanced data, the Gini score in the random forest for feature importance, and posterior distribution for data augmentation. This research used random forest and logistic regression as classification algorithms.

The adoption of ecopreneurship practices in Indonesian craft SMEs: value-based motivations and intersections of identities,"[{""Penulis"":""Gunawan, Arien Arianti""},{""Penulis"":""Essers, Caroline""},{""Penulis"":""van Riel, Allard C.R.""}]","Purpose: This article explores value-based motivations to adopt ecological entrepreneurship (ecopreneurship) practices and investigates how intersections of social identities such as gender, religion and ethnicity influence these motivations. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses primary data from field observations, social media analysis and semistructured in-depth interviews with 16 owner-managers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Indonesian craft sector. Findings: The findings show that self-enhancement, conservation and self-transcendence values motivated the entrepreneurs to adopt ecopreneurship practices. Furthermore, the intersections of identities also tended to influence the entrepreneurs' motivations to adopt ecopreneurship practices. Research limitations/implications: The sample was limited to the Indonesian craft sector. However, the study has furthered one’s understanding of how values motivate ecopreneurship behavior. Conservation values were added to the values known to influence proenvironmental behavior. Furthermore, Schwartz's value theory, strongly associated with Western, individualistic, culture is suggested to be adapted. In Asian – collectivist – cultures, the values driving the entrepreneur are often more community-oriented than individualistic. Practical implications: This study recommends policymakers to create more inclusive policies to foster the acceleration of sustainable development by equitably including both genders and encourages them to promote local culture, which motivates entrepreneurs in the craft sector to adopt ecopreneurship practices. Originality/value: The study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature, particularly to the fields of gender and ecopreneurship, by considering the intersections of identities of the ecopreneurs.

Effect of repetitive recycling on the optical properties of polypropylene based on material value conservation paradigm,"[{""Penulis"":""Fachrizal, Ahmad""},{""Penulis"":""Yastica, Tiara Verita""},{""Penulis"":""Gabriel, Djoko Sihono""}]","Good quality of plastic packaging waste has the potential to be recycled, as it can be used as raw material for the next packaging products. Recycling is preeminent due to the grave necessity of decreasing plastic production rate, especially for packaging industries which are known to use more plastic compared to other sectors. Material value conservation is a new paradigm which can be implemented through a new category of design for recycling in order to avoid value degradation. Implementations of this paradigm has produced better quality processed plastic waste with higher selling price. Applied with this paradigm, recycled plastic pellets can be a viable alternative as raw material based on its mechanical properties, even after the 8th stage of recycling. This study aims to reveal the effect of repetitive recycling on the optical properties of polypropylene with implementation of material value conservation paradigm, to strengthen previous evidence of the implementation of the material value conservation paradigm on plastic packaging whether repetitive recycling plastic packaging can be a viable alternative as raw material based on its optical properties. Optical properties observed in this research were based on the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, which are consisted of colour (ASTM D2244), gloss (ASTM D2457) and transparency (ASTM D1746).

Study of Dispersion Compensation with Dispersion Compensating Fiber in 10 Gbps Single-Mode Fiber,"[{""Penulis"":""Effendi, Nabila Syadzwina""},{""Penulis"":""Natali, Yus""},{""Penulis"":""Apriono, Catur""}]","The industrial revolution was able to solve various social challenges in society, which create a sustainable life and bring people to the uttermost advanced society, Society 5.0. In Society 5.0, a massive amount of data from the sensor will rapidly accumulate in cloud services. It requires enormous bandwidth and high-speed communication than can be achieved by using optical fiber as a transmission media. However, chromatic dispersion will limit the bandwidth and data rate due to pulse broadening, which needs compensation. Among many compensation techniques for optical fiber systems, this research investigates the effects of dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) in a single-mode-fiber (SMF) using a 10 Gbps bit rate at various source power levels. This research considers three different schemes of DCF, i.e., pre-compensation, post-compensation, and symmetrical compensation with NRZ modulation format at transmission distances up to 200 km simulated by using OptiSystem. The results show that the dispersion effect can be compensated by the proposed DCF scheme. Also, the use of amplifiers should be considered to compensate for the high attenuation effect of DCF. The system performance showed that using a three different scheme of DCF could provide a good system performance and reach a transmission distance of 200 km. © 2021 IEEE.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

However, some institutions, lecturers and students were not ready to adapt to the conditions, and it is therefore important to examine to what extent lecturers are ready to teach online. This research aims to evaluate the readiness of lecturers during a pandemic that arises unexpectedly. It also aims to investigate the weaknesses and obstacles that lecturers must overcome in order to teach an online class. This research applies a mixed-method approach. Lecturers were surveyed through online preparedness questionnaires, and several themes were constructed from the gathered qualitative data. The results show that lecturers have strong baseline technical skills to use e-learning platforms for online courses; they have quickly adapted to using a Learning Management System (LMS), and most have a tactical solution for most online classes with insufficient feasibility, but they do not have a strategic solution.

Results show that temporal data of PM2.5 and PM10 were identified as [removed]100 g/m3 (dry season). In long-term exposure to polluted air, PM2.5 contributed to mortality caused by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and ischemic heart disease. Meanwhile, post-neo-natal were observed under PM10 mass concentrations. In a short-term period of measurement, March to April and July to August, the respiratory disease has dominant across seasons. Therefore, the coupling of changes in climate and air pollution level will be negatively contributed to more effect on human health.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Objective: This study aimed to analyze differences in information security cultures (ISCs) across health care providers based on factors drawn from the ISC model. Methods: We used twelve factors to measure the ISCs of health care providers. This research applied a survey method with the Kruskal–Wallis H Test and the Mann–Whitney U Test as data analysis techniques. We collected the data through a questionnaire distributed to 470 employees of health care facilities (i.e. hospitals, community health centers, and primary care clinics) in Indonesia. Results: The results revealed the differences between health care provider types for 9 of the 12 security culture factors. Top management support, change management, and knowledge were the differentiating factors between all types of health care providers. Organizational culture and security compliance only differed in primary care clinics. Meanwhile, security behavior, soft issues and workplace independence, information security policies, training, and awareness only differed in hospitals. Conclusion: The results indicated that each type of health care provider required different approaches to develop an ISC considering the above factors.

The Design of Stroke EEG Channel Selection System Using Spatial Selection Method,"[{""Penulis"":""Utami, Irena Arvianda Wulan""},{""Penulis"":""Fauzi, Hilman""},{""Penulis"":""Fuadah, Yunendah""},{""Penulis"":""Silaen, Yolanda Sari""},{""Penulis"":""Shapiai, Mohd Ibrahim""}]","Stroke can be interpreted as a dysfunction of the nervous system that occurs suddenly and caused by blockage of blood vessels in the brain. Generally, the effort used to reduce stroke patients is the diagnostic method using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the cost of examination using the MRI method is relatively expensive and not portable. One solution to overcome this problem is to use an Electroencephalograph (EEG) device to detect stroke signals in the brain that measure electrical activity detecting abnormalities in the brain. This action uses special sensors, namely electrodes attached to the head and connected to the computer. In previous research, EEG stroke signal processing was carried out using the Brain Symmetry Index and Hilbert Huang Transform (BSI-HHT) methods. However, this study did not specifically discuss channel selection in EEG stroke signals. Given these problems, in this study, the authors will process the EEG stroke signal using the modified Spatial Selection method using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method through the active channel composition configuration so that it can be processed to obtain relevant results. Furthermore, the classification process is carried out using the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) methods. Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification shows that the spatial selection method can find the suitable channel composition with the same accuracy results as normal data in several areas. In contrast, the ELM classification can increase accuracy by 2% greater than normal data in the high mean area with a few channel compositions.  © 2021 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The use of a motor engine in transportation does not only consume a lot of gasoline but also creates depletion in fossil fuel resources which subsequently increases the EG production. The increase of EG caused the highly hazardous to the environment such as global warming that affected climate change. To overcome this problem, we investigated the effect of HR on reducing EG production and consumption of gasoline for the motor engine. We manufactured the volume 34.5mL, 40.8mL, and 56.5mL of HR, then we used Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans water as hydrogen sources. For combustion, 1L Pertalite gasoline was applied in the engine motor. The experiment was conducted in variation temperature of HR (100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C, 130 °C, 140 °C), and velocity of the motor engine (2000rpm, 3000rpm, 4000rpm). We examined that the EG production namely hydrocarbon, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide were decreasing with the use of HR compared without the HR for all experimental conditions. The result tests also show that the use of HR reduced the consumption of gasoline along with the combustion process. This study demonstrated that HR as co-combustion combined with Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans water has the potential for environmental protection such as climate change due to global EG production.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The mapping process is executed by classifying the batik SME into four quadrants. The diagram is a quadrant in which there are four parts to distinguish each of the ability of batik SMEs in understanding and achieving cleaner production through open innovation. This research will obtain a new method or model that can be applied by organizations to achieve cleaner production through an open innovation. The data is obtained from 182 batik SMEs located in Laweyan, Madura and Lasem (in Java Island, Indonesia). Design/methodology/approach: One of the problems in batik SME is the waste management from the dyeing and wax removal process. In the first stages of this research, a number of initial models were elaborated as a reference, then the results of the elaboration became a new research model. The research model that has been produced is then tested using data from respondents. Based on the test results, the model can be stated valid or not. In this study, the model is valid after testing data from 182 respondents, because all outer loading for all indicators is above 0.7. The composite reliability and AVE values of all constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5. Based on the validated research model, the data is statistically processed by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). By using the SEM method and statistical software SMART PLS 3.0this research can be supported to achieve the research objectives. Findings: Based on data testing and processing, open innovation climate could predict a sustained relationship to open innovation with an accuracy rate of 0.466 and influence rate of 0.427, whereas open innovation could predict a sustained relationship to cleaner production with an accuracy rate of 0.183 and influence rate of 0.324. The relationships between open innovation climate and open innovation; including open innovation toward cleaner production, are statistically significant because all prediction values and accuracy in the model have met the criteria for measurement parameters based on the value of R2, p value and T-statistics to be stated as a significant relationship. Research limitations/implications: This research provides an overview of the influence and importance of open innovation in creating an environmentally friendly production process in the context of cleaner production. Cleaner production on batik SMEs can be achieved through open innovation, both for inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Open innovation comprehensively provides support for batik SMEs in achieving cleaner production. Open innovation can be run well and optimally if it gets support from a conducive climate open innovation. Furthermore, the implementation of cleaner production could be a guideline for the owner to minimize the waste from batik SME production, both for natural and synthetic dyes. Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs. Originality/value: The implementation of cleaner production model is considered as one of the new methods and references in conjunction with reducing the negative impact of waste toward the environment, particularly in the traditional textile industry which is limited in waste management capability. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Surface Electromyography Quantification Methods for Evaluating Muscle Activity in Dysphagia,"[{""Penulis"":""Suprijanto""},{""Penulis"":""Noor, Azizah S.""},{""Penulis"":""Susanti, Hesty""},{""Penulis"":""Mandasari, Miranti I.""}]","Quantitative evaluation of stroke patients with the risk of swallowing disorder or dysphagia is required to support diagnosis and further rehabilitation planning. Fluoroscopy X-ray imaging usually is used for swallowing diagnosis, though it gives radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, quantification of muscle coordination patterns involved in swallowing based on surface electromyography (sEMG) was introduced. However, an adequate quantification of sEMG for dysphagia diagnosis still lacks standardization. In this work, potential sEMG signal features, namely the contraction duration (DUR), the time to peak of maximum contraction (TTP), and the total RMS power (TP), were further investigated to evaluate the swallowing processes in healthy subjects and post-stroke patients. The experimental scheme instructed the participant, i.e. 20 healthy subjects and 20 patients, to swallow 3 mL of water in normal swallowing mode and swallow saliva in dry swallowing mode. The proposed signal processing procedure helps to establish the feature extraction of the three features mentioned earlier. For dysphagia assessment, with the support of our proposed signal processing procedure, DUR and TTP can be used together to improve diagnosis reliability. The characteristic of both features in healthy subjects was shorter than in post-stroke patients. Also, the TP feature is useful as additional information to evaluate the role of suprahyoid (SUP) and infrahyoid (INF) muscle groups which are very important in the swallowing process. These results are promising to provide a reliable set of features in the time domain for swallowing analysis. Notably, this can also be utilized as a feature for supporting the automatic classification of dysphagia diagnosis. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Authenticity and Nominal Detection of Indonesian Banknotes Using ROI and CNN,"[{""Penulis"":""Yusuf, Andy Maulana""},{""Penulis"":""Suyanto, Suyanto""}]","A banknote is an economic tool used as a generally accepted medium of exchange. However, it is prone to counterfeiting, such as in Indonesia, in which the case of banknotes counterfeiting continues to increase. Hence, some computer-based applications have been developed to detect the authenticity of banknotes to reduce counterfeiting cases. Unfortunately, they focus on either nominal detection only or authenticity detection only. Besides, they use noiseless datasets and augmentation processes to be subject to overfitting or prediction errors. In this paper, the Indonesian banknote detection system is developed to identify both authenticity and nominal using the region of interest (ROI) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The evaluation shows that the authenticity model achieves a high accuracy of 95%, while the nominal classification model achieves an accuracy of 99%.  © 2021 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Network Planning Analysis of 5G Millimeter-Wave Deployment in Indonesia's Dense Urban Area,"[{""Penulis"":""Nashiruddin, Muhammad Imam""},{""Penulis"":""Rahmawati, Putri""},{""Penulis"":""Nugraha, Muhammad Adam""}]","An essential resource for the deployment of 5G technology is the frequency spectrum. A high spectrum provides high data rates and a large bandwidth to support many new devices, applications, and services that meet the needs across multiple domains. However, a high spectrum has a smaller range (10-100 m2) with a sub-6 GHz spectrum. So, it takes careful design for 5G implementation using high frequencies (mmWave). As a result, this research will plan a 5G New Radio (NR) network implementation employing a 28 GHz mmWave frequency. The dense urban scenario research design was carried out by selecting Central Jakarta as the research object. Central Jakarta was chosen as a pilot project because it is feasible in market potential and infrastructure support to pre-pare 5G implementation in Indonesia. The capacity approach considers the data rate and users, while the coverage approach considers Maximum Allowable Path Loss (MAPL) parameters and path loss propagation. A propagation model based on 3GPP TS 38.901 UMi Street. The results of this study indicate that Central Jakarta requires a traffic demand of 4.72 Gbps/km2. In addition, the deployment of a 5G NR network with mmWave frequency based on the capacity planning approach requires 33 uplink and 12 downlink gNobeB. As a result, the coverage area necessitates 738 uplink gNodeB with a coverage area of 69 m2 and 130 downlink gNodeB with a coverage area of 370 m2. Based on these results, the gNodeB needed for Central Jakarta was selected based on downlink coverage with 738 gNodeB.  © 2021 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Detecting and Counting Tuberculosis Bacilli in a Microscopic Image of Patient Sputum Using Gaussian Mixture Model,"[{""Penulis"":""Fandriyanto, Almer""},{""Penulis"":""Suyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Erawati Rajab, Tati""}]","Diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB) based on a direct microscopy observation is a challenging task due to, among others, varying qualities of the sputum preparations. Even to determine a TB-negative patient, WHO stipulates that 100-300 non-overlapping fields of view must be carried out. This is undoubtedly tiring work to do, so that it can lead to misdiagnosis in patients. This paper proposes a method to assist physicians in analyzing TB sputum preparations based on digital microscopic images of ZN-stained preparations (Ziehl-Nielsen). This study proposes using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm and Markov Random Field (MRF) parameters to segment the TB result image from its background image and count the number of TB yields in the image. This method was chosen because it has a fast computation time and can handle a limited number of image datasets. The data used in the form of 32 training data and 8 test data taken randomly from the Ziehl-Neelsen Sputum Smear Microscopy Image Database (ZNSM-iDB) dataset.

Economic growth does not just depend on prioritizing the environment or improving the environmental situation. If the foreign direct investment is directed to the polluting industries, they will increase pollution and damage the environment. The purpose of the study is to consider the relationship between foreign direct investment in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and economic growth and renewable energy consumption. The study is based on data obtained from 1992 to 2018. The results show that there is a two-way link between foreign direct investment and renewable energy consumption in the considered two countries. The Granger causality test approach is applied to explore the causal relationship between the variables. The Johansen co-integration test approach is also employed to test for a relationship. The empirical results verify the existence of co-integration between the series. The main factors influencing renewable energy are economic growth and electricity consumption. To reduce dependence on fuel-based energy sources, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan need to attract energy to renewable energy sources and implement energy efficiency based on rapid progress.

Comparative Analysis of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) Classification for Cancer Detection using Microarray,"[{""Penulis"":""Irawansyah""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""},{""Penulis"":""Astuti, Widi""}]","Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, approximately 9.6 million deaths were caused by cancer. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths are caused by cancer. One way to detect cancer is to use microarray data classification. Microarray technology is used to detect the expression of thousands of genes at the same time to analyze and diagnose cancer. However, microarray data have high dimensions because of its large features and low data distribution, which means that it has a small data samples, which causes low performance. To overcome this problem, dimension reduction is needed. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the dimensions of microarray data with Random Projection (RP) to reduce the high dimensions and use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) as classification methods. The classification method will be compared and analyzed to determine which classification method produces the best performance by using Random Projection (RP) as a dimensional reduction method.

Application of the TAM Model to Assess the Acceptance Level of Indonesian Artists on the Use of Virtual Gallery,"[{""Penulis"":""Wahyudin, Ade Irfan""},{""Penulis"":""Yasirandi, Rahmat""},{""Penulis"":""Oktaria, Dita""}]","Corona Virus Disease (COVID) has had a tremendous impact on the fabric of life in Indonesia, whether in the medical, economic or social, and political fields. One of the government's efforts to recover everything back is to stop the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing. Artists' efforts to support recovery in the pandemic era are by using virtual galleries. A virtual gallery is a place to exhibit art but online. The case studies in this study will be taken from Indonesian artists in Bandung, especially those who have used virtual galleries. This study aims to measure the level of acceptance of virtual galleries by Indonesian artists in Bandung by using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) method. Five components measured by TAM include: PEU (Perceived Ease of Use), PU (Perceived Usefulness), ATU (Attitude Toward Using), BIU (Behavioral Intention to Use), and AU (Actual Use). Analysis method is using quantitative descriptive and data collection technique used a survey method approach with purposive sampling technique, and the respondents were users of the virtual gallery application in the city of Bandung with 25 respondents. The validity test will use product-moment correlation, and the reliability test will use Cronbach Alpha. Then for the analysis will use simple linear regression through the SPSS application. This study has six initial hypotheses, namely H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6, where the six hypotheses have a positive and significant effect, meaning virtual gallery is accepted among artists. © 2021 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Image Processing Framework for Pleural Line (A-Line) Detection in Video Lung Ultrasonography,"[{""Penulis"":""Susanti, Hesty""},{""Penulis"":""Suprijanto""}]","The implementation of Point-of-care Ultrasound (POCUS) for lung imaging has significant potential in the diagnostic of lung abnormalities through the detection of artifacts in lung ultrasonography (LUS), i.e., pleural line (A-line) and vertical comet-tail artifact (B-line). Detecting the pleural line pattern is an essential feature for further lung diagnosis based on machine learning. A healthy lung correlates with the regular repeated horizontal A-line with a fixed distance between the lines and, ideally, produces a higher intensity. This preliminary work focuses on developing an image processing framework for automatic pleural line (A-line) detection in time series B-mode ultrasound images (video) in a healthy subject as an early stage of further lung image interpretations COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The proposed scheme is based on a top-hat morphological grayscale filter with a texture structure element. An adaptive low pass filter that considers local shape parameter is used to suppress noise and keep the curve line information related to the pleural line. The proposed scheme is evaluated for an open dataset of video LUS. The proposed method can successfully detect the pleural line automatically for typical video LUS acquired using a curved transducer. © 2021 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Facial Expression Classification for User Experience Testing Using K-Nearest Neighbor,"[{""Penulis"":""Afriansyah, Yudha""},{""Penulis"":""Nugrahaeni, Ratna Astuti""},{""Penulis"":""Prasasti, Anggunmeka Luhur""}]","One of the important steps of testing out applications such as video game is getting the information regarding user experience. Emotion from the testers while playing can be used as a parameter of the user experience. Emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness, or surprise can be seen from changes in facial expressions. These emotional parameters can be used as feedback for satisfaction or deficiency in the video game so that developers can increase the improvement of the final product of the game. This project discusses the human facial expression classification system to test video games using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification method and using the Indonesia Mixed Emotion Dataset (IMED) as training data and trial data. In this system, there are several processes, namely preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Finally, this system issues a classification of facial expressions detected in the form of chart that can be used in user experience testing.

K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm for Prediction Shelf Life of Rice Based on Electronic Nose Dataset,"[{""Penulis"":""Hanif, Syahrizal""},{""Penulis"":""Wijaya, Dedy Rahman""},{""Penulis"":""Wikusna, Wawa""}]","In Indonesia, rice is a food commodity that has a strategic and vital role. Considering rice's importance, the government always strives to ensure food needs and a surplus of rice as food reserves. However, rice has decreased in quality and is not suitable for consumption in recent years. Conventionally, the rice shelf life prediction methods use the direct method that the rice samples are tested by smelling the rice using the human sense of smell to predict how long rice's shelf life is. Therefore, we propose another method to predict how long rice's shelf life. Developing a prediction system for the shelf life of rice uses the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and electronic nose (E-nose) dataset to predict how long rice's shelf life more quickly. This experiment showed that the k-NN Regression algorithm obtained the best parameters with the R2 score of 0.7217 and the RMSE score of 3.8043.

Television Documentary Program Indonesia Bagus; A Semiotic Social Analysis,"[{""Penulis"":""Yusanto, Freddy""},{""Penulis"":""Hidayat, Dadang Rahmat""},{""Penulis"":""Irawan, Rahmat Edi""},{""Penulis"":""Piliang, Yasraf Amir""}]","Indonesian society, which has been under siege by popular culture, has led its people to think popularly. This has created an ideology of popularism and popular imagination which will lead us to think in an instant, profane and superficial. Popular culture is built through production in the mass media industry and marketed for the benefit of consumers. One of them is a television program. Programs that generate high ratings and shares will always be produced. We see that the biggest challenge is how television programs, especially documentaries, can be packaged into something that generates high ratings and shares. Through social semiotics, we argue that the television documentary program “Indonesia Bagus” episode “Potential Natural Resources in Klaten” presents five things in presenting local cultural values (harmony, respect, cooperation) of the Indonesian nation. The first, program maker sensitivity in perceiving and understanding the uniqueness of a region. Second, presenting the meaning of local culture through historical information. Third, presenting the interaction between shots and maintaining the interaction between elements in the shot to represent reality. Fourth, presenting an objective and subjective camera point of view dynamically to build audience interest in a documentary television program and the fifth, presenting back sound (direct sound or music) to create a harmonious unity scene. The information on local cultural values deserves to be presented as program content by local media as an antidote to the negative effects of popular culture on local culture. © 2021. RIGEO.

The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled 'Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,' collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques-Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes-were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance. Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP. These models can be used to design customised ESPs that can effectively manage the financial burden of low-income households. © 2021 Kannan R et al.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Though there exists literature on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and pollution haven hypothesis (PHH), very few explore the scope in the light of Belt and Road host countries (B&RCs). Therefore, the study examines the income-induced EKC and Chinese outward foreign direct investment (FDI)-based PHH in the multivariate framework of people’s connectivity and technology innovation in B&RCs from 2003 to 2018. The outcome of the study reveals that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent, which may disclose misleading results in previous studies using traditional methodologies that address the averages. Utilizing the novel “Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR)” of Machado and Silva (J Econom 213:145–173, 2019), the findings confirm an inverted U-shape association between economic growth and CO2 emissions only at lower to medium emission countries, thus validating the EKC hypothesis. The Chinese outward FDI flows increase carbon emissions at medium to high emission countries, thereby confirming PHH. The findings also indicate that people’s connectivity contributes to increasing emissions while innovation mitigates carbon emissions at lower to medium polluted countries. Moreover, the outcomes of Granger causality confirm one-way causality between economic growth and CO2 emissions, between FDI and CO2 emissions, between people’s connectivity and CO2 emissions, and between innovation and CO2 emissions. The results offer valuable insight for legislators to counteract CO2 emissions in B&RCs through innovation-led energy conservation in infrastructure projects while adopting green and sustainable financing mechanisms to materialize mega construction projects under the BRI. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

However, this method results in the depletion of clay and an increase in energy consumption. In addition, biomass lignocellulosic waste such as corn also increased along with population growth. Some studies reported the utilization of corn lignocellulosic waste to protect the environment in the biomass refinery. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the potential of corn lignocellulosic waste addition in the fired clay bricks production. The mixing of clay/corn lignocellulosic waste (500μm size) with a ratio of 2.5% of the total weight of bricks was used in the manufacturing of fired brick. The raw bricks were then burned by using a temperature of 600 °C. Then, the influences of corn lignocellulosic waste impregnation fired clay brick was examined in terms of density, porosity, and compressive strength. The density of the mixture of clay/corn lignocellulosic waste brick was lower than clay brick, 1.437 gram/cm3 versus 1.521 gram/cm3, respectively. The porosity of the mixture of clay/corn lignocellulosic waste brick was lower than clay brick, 27.3% versus 35.79% respectively. However, the compressive strength of the mixture of clay/corn lignocellulosic waste brick was higher than clay brick, 6.81 MPa versus 4.15 MPa, respectively.

The conceptual model used in the impact study of the impact of tangible and intangible elements related to city branding. Involving 423 tourists visiting four cities in West Java, Indonesia as an assessment of the variables studied. The results showed that the conclusions on cognitive image, city brand equity and brand commitment were low. While the other categories are classified as good. These findings also reveal the analysis of the relationship between variables, including cognitive image variables that have a significant effect on city brand equity. Cognitive image is explained through the dimensions of quality experience, tourist attraction, infrastructure environment, and outdoor activities. Meanwhile, city brand equity is measured by brand awareness, brand loyalty, and brand value. Furthermore, the results also show that the variable city brand equity has a significant effect on the variable word-of-mouth (WOM), brand commitment, and the intention to revisit. The most significant influence exerted on brand commitment. These results indicate that the condition of city brand equity affects how word-of-mouth, brand commitment, intention to revisit.

Pleural Line Detection Enhancement In Lung Ultrasonography (Lus) Based On Morphological And Adaptive Structural 2d Filter,"[{""Penulis"":""Suprijanto""},{""Penulis"":""Susanti, Hesty""}]","Lung ultrasonography (LUS) imaging has been used intensively to investigate and assess the lung’s various pathological conditions. A diagnostic system of lung abnormalities is developed to detect and localize the pleural line that can be viewed as the artifacts in LUS image. The continuous pleural line indicates one crucial pattern of a healthy lung. The regular repeated horizontal A-line marks this pattern with a fixed distance between the lines and ideally, produces a higher contrast in the lung image. This work proposes an image processing framework for enhancing pleural line detection in healthy subjects and patients as an early stage of further lung image interpretations in pneumonia patients. The proposed image processing framework is based on a top-hat morphological grayscale 2D filter with a texture structure element and an adaptive structural 2D low pass filter. This framework is evaluated for open dataset video ultrasonography (USG) of Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to enhance the pleural line detection for typical video LUS acquired using a linear and a convex transducer. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’S Office","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The accessibility to better-quality coastal water will enhance safety and public health awareness when the information is available. Existing platforms showing the risk of whether a beach is suitable for public recreational use is less available in Malaysia. The Internet of Things (IoT) based system design specifically for coastal recreational suitability may differ from the existing configuration depending on the environment and requirements. This paper reports the design and implementation of an IoT-based system to capture the coastal environmental data and recommend recreational suitability. The system captures sensor data, store it in a database and displays the result using a dashboard. The variable data include the temperature, humidity, rain, pH, turbidity, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and total dissolved solids (TDS) in a coastal area. The hardware used in the design is the development boards such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, and ESP32 controller. The system is developed using PHP, MySQL, and Apache Web Server and can be accessed online at https://ipantai.xyz. When using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) as the effective messaging protocol and HiveMQ broker, the result has shown improvement for message size, throughput, and power consumption.

The DKI Jakarta flood disaster in early 2020 made a big scene on trending twitter topics. This study aims to classify these tweets into ""flooded""and ""not flooded""predictions with the tweets and geospatial features. The model proposed for classifying is BERT-MLP. Bidirectional Encoder from Transformers (BERT) is used in the pre-trained model to classify these tweets and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to classify geospatial features. The scenario designed for the model focuses on the preprocessing of tweets as follows without stopword removal, without stemming, with both, and without both. Once classified, the tweet will be visualized into a two-dimensional interactive map. The best scenario results have an accuracy of 82% in scenarios without stemming and with stopword removal. This is due to the stemming process eliminates some of the features in tweets around 6%. This study also shows the relationship between the influence of negative context tweets on the ""not flooded""class with an orientation of 65% of the total data.

The 5G and other services are mandatory, supported by a large mobile backhaul capacity. 10-Gigabit-capable symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON) has the potential to resolve this issue because it can deliver 10 Gbps upstream and downstream simultaneously. This study evaluates the XGS-PON's performance to implement mobile backhaul in a cellular network in Indonesia. This paper proposes a method for ONT testing that is implemented for mobile backhaul. This test method supports the evaluation of device performance in the physical layer and data link layer. The testing results confirmed that XGS-PON ONT supported mobile backhaul with a nominal rate of 9.65296 Gbps, an operating wavelength of 1269.509 nm, launch power 5.63 dBm, sensitivity -26.64 dBm, and overload -5.92 dBm. The functionality test shows that the XGS-PON ONT supports jumbo frames of 2000-9000 bytes, 4096 VLAN IDs, forward VLAN tagging, and un-tagging transparently passes the desired tagging VLANs. The IEEE 1588v2 synchronization test results show that time Synch Accuracy is 53 ns, and sync-e is 0.058 ppb for frequency offset. In conclusion, all test results have complied with ITU-T G.9807, IEEE 802.1q, and Broadband Forum technical reports except for sensitivity results that have not met the specification value of -28 dBm.

The algorithm is designed by modifying the recently presented hybrid PSO and BA (HPSOBA) algorithm applied for the achievement of the optimal solution of the EDPs. The modified algorithm is implemented to solve EDPs of all RESs-based power systems for three scenarios, without constraints, with time-varying demand, and with the consideration of regional load sharing dispatch (RLSD). The performance of the algorithm is also verified through the implementation of various combinations of hybrid as well as thermal power plants (TPPs). The case of TPPs consists of three different scenarios: 1) a small-scale system with constraints like ramp-rate limits (RRLs), prohibited operating zones (POZs), and power losses; 2) a medium-scale power system with consideration of emission-economic dispatch (EED); 3) a large-scale power system with valve-point loading (VPL) effect. The results of the designed MHPSO-BAAC algorithm are compared with the various metaheuristic algorithms available in the literature and the comparative analysis shows the superior performance of the developed algorithm in terms of fuel cost reduction, fast convergence, and computational time.

The increasing level of air pollution contributed by the release of dangerous air particles are seriously degrading visibility and causing a respiratory problem to many people. Installation of air quality monitoring system in critical areas to determine the trends of ambient air quality for prevention and corrective measures is necessary. Some existing systems are costly, require high maintenance and are not widely available in many areas. This paper presents a portable and light-weight air quality monitoring system using a wireless sensor network (WSN) to monitor the air quality in the outdoor environment and provide a remote access. Our proposed system monitors the major air pollutants which are carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matters with diameter less than 2.5 micron (PM2.5), and carbon dioxide (CO2) and records the temperature and humidity readings. LoRa technology is used to achieve the long-range data transmission and the transmitted data are then stored in the cloud server for future use and easy access. The air pollution index (API) is used as an indicator of the air quality to provide the status of the air quality. The finding of this paper indicates that the air in the rural area is less polluted than the air in the urban area, which is mainly contributed by the rapid economic development, vehicle exhaust fumes, and chemical discharge.  © 2021 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

How Can National Identity Card Reduce Authentication Risks in Enterprise Attendance Management System?,"[{""Penulis"":""Aziz, Abdul""},{""Penulis"":""Sukarno, Parman""},{""Penulis"":""Yasirandi, Rahmat""}]","The attendance process is widespread today in Indonesia. One everyday use case is recording attendance at an enterprise. However, the existing attendance system still poses some risks. One of the biggest causes is when the smart card used does not have a good quality guarantee and does not use an official Indonesian identity card, namely e-KTP. This issue causes the wasteful use of smart cards. In addition, this is not under the Law of the Republic of Indonesia. Therefore, this research focuses on utilizing the e-KTP as an authentication factor in recording attendance. In addition, this study uses two methods: survey methods and theoretical methods. As a result, the proposed mechanism system has fewer steps than the current enterprise's (2 out of 3). With the e-KTP, the conclusion obtained indicate that the proposed mechanism has successfully mitigated all technical existing risks (R2, R4, and R5). User Agreement Testing also shows the same results, participant's perspectives of R1 and R3 scenarios more feel comfortable with e-KTP as the proposed ID cards in their enterprise.

Drought occurs in an expected time so that preparations and preparedness can be made in dealing with drought disasters. Therefore, we need an overview of future drought events (or projections). In this study, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used as a drought index. The occurrence of drought is closely related to weather factors and occurs repeatedly. Time-series weather data is needed to know the time-series weather conditions. Problems with data that often occur can be overcome by anumerical climate modeling, which is currently widely used. Regional Climate Model (RCM) is a climate model that can be used to build long-term climate data, both time-series and projection data. The results showed RCM model data required bias correction to reduce bias in the CORDEX-SEA RCM model data. RCM rainfall models before correction were still biased. Thus, bias correction is needed to reduce bias in models’ data. The results showed ensemble model correction value is the closest to the CHIRPS observation rainfall pattern with r= 0.97. The average annual rainfall during 2000-2005 showed an ensemble model is the closest to the CHIRPS observation with a range of 2500-3000 mm/year. © 2021, Pusat Penelitian Lingkungan Hidup - Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat Institut Pertanian Bogor (PPLH-LPPM IPB).

At present, the sector is of concern to the public because infrastructure development is increasing as evidenced by an increased budget every year. Thus, attracting the desire of the community to invest in the sector. However, stock returns in this sector not only increased but also decreased. This study aims to determine the effect of financial ratios and macroeconomics in the Infrastructure sector on stock returns partially and simultaneously. The Secondary data testing to determine the effect partially and simultaneously was done using a panel data regression. Panel data regression results shows one point Debt to Equity Ratio (DER) and Earning per Share (EPS) can reduce stock returns, then one point Return on Equity (ROE) can increase stock returns partially. However, all variables simultaneously have a significant effect on stock returns because of the value of prob (F-statistic) less than 0.05. The conclusion is that six variables significantly influence simultaneously, but only DER, ROE, and EPS have a partially significant effect.

This study discusses a brief analysis of the effect of the internal gas pressure of an anaerobic digester on biogas production. The substrate used in this research as producing biogas is a mixture of cow dung/tofu liquid waste ratio of 2 (v/v). Therefore, the two identical biogases reactor with different treatments were developed, with (controlled) and without (uncontrolled) internal gas pressure treatment. The parameters such as temperature and methane gas amount were evaluated for nine days; moreover, the biogas production was monitored daily using a calibrated methane gas sensor. The uncontrolled biogas reactor produced methane gas lower than the controlled biogas reactor, 92074 ppm versus 254451 ppm, respectively, after nine days of reaction time. The uncontrolled biogas reactor's internal gas pressure was higher than the internal gas pressure of the controlled biogas reactor, 89.29 kPa versus 29.84 kPa, respectively, after nine days reaction time. The retention time of uncontrolled biogas production was longer than the retention time of biogas production of controlled biogas reactor, six days versus five days, respectively.

Empowering Islamic boarding schools by applying the humane entrepreneurship approach: the case of Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Anggadwita, Grisna""},{""Penulis"":""Dana, Leo-Paul""},{""Penulis"":""Ramadani, Veland""},{""Penulis"":""Ramadan, Reza Yanuar""}]","Purpose: Islamic boarding schools are education institutions that have been developing in Indonesia as places for the Indonesian people to learn and gain knowledge in the perspectives of the Islamic religion and Indonesian nationalism. This study aims to explore the potential of Islamic boarding schools as places to support and to empower the economy and to increase the participation of students in entrepreneurial activities by applying the Humane Entrepreneurship approach. This study identifies the humane entrepreneurship approach by analyzing the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle in the entrepreneurship activities occurring in a single case study of an Islamic boarding school. Design/methodology/approach: This article used a qualitative method with a case study approach through deep exploration and observation. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with the key people in one of the Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia using a purposive sampling technique. Miles and Huberman (1984) technique was used for data analysis by grouping similar text segments into codes and categorizing them for further analysis. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that the Islamic boarding school has implemented humane entrepreneurship through entrepreneurial-oriented activities as the main aspects of the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle. The implementation of humane entrepreneurship aims to achieve entrepreneurial growth, innovation and independence of the Islamic boarding school, as well as the development of the stakeholder's capabilities, knowledge and commitment. In addition, applying the spiritual approach, which is one of the important components of Islamic boarding schools, has proven to be effective in implementing humane entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations. First, this study only focused on one Islamic boarding school in Indonesia. Second, there is still very little research in the field of humane entrepreneurship, so the concept itself is still considered to be relatively new. Therefore, further direction is needed for future research regarding the exploration and identification of any other factors that might influence humane entrepreneurship. Originality/value: This study provides new insights on the implementation of humane entrepreneurship in Islamic boarding schools. This research covers the gap where the humane entrepreneurial approach can be applied not only in large organizations, but also in religious educational institutions. The spiritual approach and religious values as the principles of Islamic boarding schools have been proven to be effective in implementing humane entrepreneurship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Exploring the reliability of different artificial intelligence techniques in predicting earthquake for Malaysia,"[{""Penulis"":""Essam, Yusuf""},{""Penulis"":""Kumar, Pavitra""},{""Penulis"":""Ahmed, Ali Najah""},{""Penulis"":""Murti, Muhammad Ary""},{""Penulis"":""El-Shafie, Ahmed""}]","Earthquakes have been universally recognised as seismological disasters that pose a threat to civilization and need to be monitored through prediction models. The development and usage of traditional statistical predicting models, which require the understanding of underlying physical scientific processes in a system and large amounts of data preparation, can be challenging and costly. Artificial intelligence-based models, specifically machine learning models, are able to easily review mass data volumes and identify complex data trends to make predictions, making them beneficial to be utilized as prediction models. Terengganu, located on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, has experienced three earthquakes in the last four decades and has the potential to be hit or affected by earthquakes due to its location within the vicinity of the South China Sea where the seismologically active Manila Trench is situated. This makes the development of machine learning models for the prediction of earthquakes in Terengganu important for future disaster analysis and management. Therefore, this study suggests artificial neural network (ANN) models as a tool to predict ground motion parameters, namely earthquake acceleration, depth, and velocity, in Terengganu. However, this study presents the comparison of the results of ANN with the results of Random Forest (RF). The data used to develop the models were collected by six seismological stations for two channels in Terengganu and provided by the Malaysian Meteorological Department. The data was partitioned into six sets for each ground motion parameter in each channel, with each set utilizing data from a different grouping of five stations for training and one station for testing. Earthquake depth was able to be modelled with accuracy univariately, that is using only the respective output parameter, which is earthquake depth, as the input parameter. Earthquake acceleration and velocity could not be modelled with accuracy univariately, and were improved by adding earthquake depth as an input parameter. Based on the analysis and evaluation of the results using four selected performance criteria, the ANN models show good performance in predicting earthquake acceleration, depth, and velocity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Performance Evaluation of SD-WAN Deployment for XYZ Enterprise Company in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Soejantono, Gemilang Kurniawan""},{""Penulis"":""Nashiruddin, Muhammad Imam""},{""Penulis"":""Hertiana, Sofia Naning""},{""Penulis"":""Nugraha, Muhammad Adam""}]","Internet use has been exceptional during the previous several decades. As a result, Wide Area Network (WAN), employed in all types of inter-data center, enterprise, and carrier networks, has become a vital infrastructure since it serves as one of the internet's most crucial transmission mediums. However, due to the transfer of enterprise data to the cloud, internet traffic in the future is changing. As a result, traditional WAN connectivity will be inadequate. One of the viable solutions to this is to implement Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) for enterprises, particularly in Business-to-Business (B2B). SD-WAN replaces existing Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) with multi-broadband internet with high bandwidth, encrypted with Virtual Private Network (VPN) IP Sec standard, and simplifies branch management with a single dashboard covering multiple branches. This study aims to evaluate the performance of deploying SD-WAN on mining enterprises' public links such as Direct Internet Access (DIA), fixed broadband, and 4G LTE, and private links, namely, Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) and Multi-Protocol Layer Switching (MPLS), by utilizing SD-WAN's architecture and scenarios testing with the head office in Jakarta and branch office in Balikpapan. The results obtained that SD-WAN works appropriately when one of the multiple links is down. Meanwhile, when multiple links are down, the SD-WAN can still access a Voice over IP (VoIP) and video conference between the head office in Jakarta and a branch office in Balikpapan.  © 2021 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
New product development process design for small and medium enterprises: A systematic literature review from the perspective of open innovation,"[{""Penulis"":""Iqbal, Muhammad""},{""Penulis"":""Suzianti, Amalia""}]","New product development (NPD) is essential for large, as well as small and medium, enterprises (SMEs). Despite its importance for the economy, challenges remain in the NPD in SMEs. Product success is related with the NPD process, so it is important for SMEs to be able to design their NPD process. This paper aims to identify SME’s NPD research topics, the characteristics of the NPD process in SMEs, and important aspects to be considered for NPD process design. The literature review is done with the analysis of 99 selected academic articles from Scopus and ScienceDirect. Content analysis, bibliographic analysis, and clustering method (based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient) are used to conduct the identification. Less-formal processes, informal strategic planning, limited resources, need technology support, and lack of capabilities in certain fields are some of the characteristics of SME’s NPD. Collaborative product development, competitive advantage, information and communication technology (ICT), concurrent engineering, quality function deployment, and continuous improvement are important keywords based on previous research in SME’s NPD. Design activities in NPD, collaboration and source of innovation, and process modelling, tools, and techniques appear to be important aspects related with the SME’s NPD process. © 2021 by the authors.

Process Mining on the Extended Event Log to Analyse the System Usage During Healthcare Processes (Case Study: The GP Tab Usage During Chemotherapy Treatments),"[{""Penulis"":""Kurniati, Angelina Prima""},{""Penulis"":""Hall, Geoff""},{""Penulis"":""Hogg, David""},{""Penulis"":""Johnson, Owen""}]","In healthcare, process mining has been used in many case studies to discover and analyse process models of patient treatments. Process mining is generally applied to analyse the event log of patient treatments as extracted from the Electronic Health Record (EHR). In this study, we proposed an approach to combine the event log of patient treatments with the clinical user access log of the hospital information system to analyse system usage during patient treatments. Our case study combined an event log of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatments in the Leeds Cancer Centre with the user access log in the hospital information system. The event log of patient records during chemotherapy was extracted from the EHR system. The clinical user access log was extracted from the Splunk web-based log management system in the hospital. Combining records from those two logs has been useful to provide information on system usage during patient treatment. Our experiment focused on the GPTab, a functionality that allows clinicians during consultations to check on patient records on their GP visits. We applied both statistical and clinical evaluations to ensure that the findings are statistically correct and clinically meaningful. We captured the phenomena of the decreasing number of patients on the subsequent cycles of chemotherapy and when GPTab has been used during the course of chemotherapy. This approach is potentially useful for general cases to analyse system usage during process execution and can be applied to investigate the effects of system changes to process executions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Memory, language and behavior tests can be used for the analysis of cognitive impairment caused by PSD. Often a supporting clinical examination such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to support the diagnosis or analyze the characteristic changes that occur in the brain. Conventional analysis or visual inspection of EEG signals can be very difficult, since the nature of the signal tends to be non-stationer. Therefore, this study proposes a quantitative analysis for the characterization of EEG signals in stroke survivors with dementia. It is thought that it has different characteristics with the normal subject so that this study can be used as a reference in supporting dementia detection in poststroke survivors. The quantitative analysis used in this study is coherence analysis. Coherence analysis was performed on EEG signals recorded from six poststroke patients with dementia and then compared with ten normal healthy subjects. Analysis of coherence between brain areas includes inter and intra-hemispheric coherence.

Deployment of 5G NR at mmWave Frequency for Mobile Network in Indonesia's Market,"[{""Penulis"":""Nashiruddin, Muhammad Imam""},{""Penulis"":""Rahmawati, Putri""},{""Penulis"":""Nugraha, Muhammad Adam""},{""Penulis"":""Akhmad, Akhmad""}]","The large bandwidth generated by the high-band millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency causes the mmWave to provide a faster access speed. However, this frequency has an area coverage that is not as wide as the sub-6 GHz frequency coverage. As a result, implementing 5G NR using mmWave frequencies is expected to require a more significant number of gNodeB than other 5G frequencies. Therefore, this research will design a 5G NR network deployment using a mmWave frequency of 28 GHz. The research design was carried out for the urban scenario by selecting the Bandung city as the research object. The Bandung city was chosen because it is one of the cities made into the 5G plan by the Ministry of Communication and Information in Indonesia. This research performs calculation modeling with planning approaches based on capacity and coverage with study prediction time from 2021 to 2026. The capacity approach considers the number of market users, while the coverage approach considers Maximum Allowable Path Loss (MAPL) parameters and path loss propagation. A propagation model based on 3GPP 28.90 UMi Street canyon for LOS conditions. According to the findings of this research, Bandung City's traffic demand is 2.18 Gbps/km2. In addition, the deployment of a 5G NR network with mmWave frequency based on capacity planning approach requires 21 uplink and 18 downlink gNobeBs. Therefore, the coverage area requires 1370 uplink gNodeB with a coverage area of 0.122 km2 and 1452 gNodeB for downlink with a coverage area of 0.115 km2. Based on these results, the gNodeB needed for Bandung city was selected based on downlink coverage with 1452 gNodeB. © 2021 IEEE","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Assessing a Measurement Model of Self-regulated learning in an Online Collaborative Learning Environment,"[{""Penulis"":""Hasibuan, Muhammad Azani""},{""Penulis"":""Reynolds, Mark""},{""Penulis"":""Male, Sally""},{""Penulis"":""Hassan, Ghulam Mubashar""},{""Penulis"":""Kusumasari, Tien Fabrianti""}]","CONTEXT The ability of students to regulate their learning process is essential to the success of their education. This metacognitive ability is also called self-regulation of learning (SRL). The importance of SRL in education has been becoming a motivating factor for many researchers to develop the measurement model for students' SRL behaviour. One of the SRL measurement models in online learning is Online Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ), developed by Bernard et al.(2008). Several studies have tested, adapted and translated the OSLQ in different contexts. However, none of these studies assessed the OSLQ in online-collaborative learning environments, especially in Indonesia. PURPOSE The current study aims to assess the OSLQ measurement model's fitness in an Indonesian online collaborative learning environment. The result of this study will provide additional evidence to the validity of OSLQ as an instrument for measuring SRL in online learning, particularly for online collaborative learning. METHODS We collected questionnaire (Online Self-regulated Learning questionnaire) data from 277 students. We perform confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) through R studio software to assess the model's fitness to the data. As the indicators for the good of fitness of the model, we used several indices, like CFI, LTI, RMSEA, SRMR and Chisq/df ratio. OUTCOMES Based on the result of CFA, we obtained the value for each index as follow, Chisq/df = 1.66, CFI = 0.926, TLI= 0.914, RMSEA = 0.055, and SRMR = 0.065. All the indicators showed that the OSLQ model has the goodness of fit to the data. CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, we can conclude that the OSLQ can be used d as a measurement model for online collaborative learning.

Routing protocol being one of many factors that impact power consumption in a node sensor. LEACH protocol is one of a routing protocols in WSN that focused on power consumption in a node sensor. However, Cluster Head (CH) in LEACH protocol forwarding the packet directly to the sink node, so CH which located far from sink node will running out of energy sooner than the closer one. This research develops methods to save power usage from sensor node and to eliminate long link in LEACH protocol so WSN lifetime could be extended. PEGASIS protocol chaining method are adapted to eliminate long link. This method allows CHs to establish chain connection instead of forwarding the packet to sink node directly. The packet will relay forwarded from a CH to other CH up to Leader Node (LN). In this research, LN that elected is CH with the closest distance to sink node. From the simulation results, compared between proposed method with LEACH and PEGASIS. Based on comparison, proposed method had longer lifetime than LEACH protocol. But if compared with PEGASIS, lifetime in proposed method end sooner than PEGASIS.

Therefore, the micro and macro factors influencing employee ecological behaviour (EEB) are a rising interest among researchers. The contemporary concept of EEB has been embraced by many organi-sations and attracted scholars’ attention worldwide. Nevertheless, studies that explored challenges and solutions for performing EEB at the workplace are scarce. This study explored challenges and solutions in performing EEB at the workplace and focused on qualitative research methodology. The researchers interviewed 24 academicians from five leading green research Malaysian universi-ties. Valuable qualitative data and numerous challenges such as high costs of practising, lack of infrastructure, top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as challenges in applying EEB from the interviews. Stringent rules and regulations, monitoring, training programmes, and monetary incentives might be efficient solutions to apply ecological behaviour at workplaces, specifically universities. In conclusion, this study has discovered the challenges and solutions in implementing EEB for a sustainable workplace by interviewing academicians from different departments of selected Malaysian higher educational institutes. Also, poor infrastructure, high cost, and the lack of top management support, environmental attitude, green mindfulness, enforcement, and monitoring were identified as the primary challenges in performing EEB. Additionally, the research also discovered significant suggestions to resolve the challenges when implementing EEB at the workplace, such as strict rules and regula-tions, training programmes, incentives, monitoring, and communicating change and campaigns. Therefore, the stakeholders related to the industry should be concerned with the challenges identified when applying EEB at the workplace to apply the solutions generated from the study. © 2021 by the authors.

Contextual route recommendation system in heterogeneous traffic flow,"[{""Penulis"":""Nasution, Surya Michrandi""},{""Penulis"":""Husni, Emir""},{""Penulis"":""Kuspriyanto, Kuspriyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Yusuf, Rahadian""},{""Penulis"":""Yahya, Bernardo Nugroho""}]","The traffic composition in developing countries comprises of variety of vehicles which include cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles. Motorcycles dominate the road with 77.5% compared to other types. Meanwhile, route recommendation such as navigation and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is limited to particular vehicles only. In this research, we propose a framework for a contextual route recommendation system that is compatible with traffic conditions and vehicle type, along with other relevant attributes (traffic prediction, weather, temperature, humidity, heterogeneity, current speed, and road length). The framework consists of two phases. First, it predicts the traffic conditions by using Knowledge-Growing Bayes Classifier on which the dataset is obtained from crawling the public CCTV feeds and TomTom digital map application for each observed road. The performances of the traffic prediction are around 60.78–73.69%, 63.64–77.39%, and 60.78–73.69%, for accuracy, precision, and recall respectively. Second, to accommodate the route recommendation, we simulate and utilize a new measure, called road capacity value, along with the Dijkstra algorithm. By adopting the compatibility, the simulation results could show alternative paths with the lowest RCV (road capacity value). © 2021 by the authors.

The difference in hormone levels makes the two genders distinguishable from several aspects. One of the things that are influenced by hormones is sweat. The odor of sweat is related to the apocrine glands found in human armpits. This experiment studied the classification of both genders based on daytime sweat in adult human armpits. The sampling method used an electronic nose (E-nose) system to collect the armpit sweat odor. The E-nose system sensor array consisted of seven sensors: TGS 822, TGS 2612, TGS 2620, TGS 826, TGS 2603, TGS 2600, and TGS 813.

Lyapunov stability analysis of covid 19 SIR modeling,"[{""Penulis"":""Mahayana, Dimitri""},{""Penulis"":""Anwari, Sabat""},{""Penulis"":""Sulistyo, Budi""},{""Penulis"":""Rahman, Fadel Nararia""},{""Penulis"":""Natanael, David Petra""}]","COVID-19 is an infectious disease which is spreading as a global pandemy to the whole world. This paper exlplores nonlinear compartemental dynamic models which is used to model the spread of Covid-19. The Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model is one of the compartmental dynamic models which can be used to simulate what happens when someone in the community catches a disease, like Covid-19. The classical SIR model assumes that the properties of individuals can be divided into three distinct compartments: S(t) is the total of susceptible persons, I(t) is the total of infected persons and R(t) is the total of recovered person from infection and are now immune against the disease. The model also includes the dedicated effort of the government, the decision makers, and the stakeholders. Theoretically, interventions such as social distancing, mass testing, and isolation of positive cases should slow the rate of the infection spreads. The analysis of equilibrium indicates that the model has two equilibriums. One of them isthe disease free equilibrium and the other one is the endemic equilibrium. If the effort level less than minimum level, than the spread of the virus becomes endemic and if the effort level more than minimum level, than the spread of the virus can be controlled. The basic reproduction number R0, is used to be an indicator of the expected number of individuals directly infected by an infectious person in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. If R0 < 1, then the disease free equilibrium point is stable, meaning that the virus spread can be controlled. If R0 > 1, then the disease free equilibrium point is unstable, meaning that the virus spread will continue. By constructing suitable Lyapunov function for SIR covid-19 model, the stability of the disease free equilibrium state of the model is thereby established. © 2021, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

Today, tourists face difficulties to find information to meet their needs or exceed their expectations due to the huge amount of information in the current Web and tourism portals. This has made the tourists or travelers decision to visit a particular destination very difficult. The main purpose of this research is to propose a conceptual integrated model to determine the factors influencing tourist’s intentions to use Web3.0. Therefore, despite the enormous transformative innovation that the Web3.0 will provide, there is still a significant gap between the current applied systems and the new technology at this moment. Besides that, the literature has shown that there are only few publications that used integrated theoretical model of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Delone and Mclean Information System Model (DMISM) to investigate tourist’s intention to use new technology particularly Web 3.0. In addition, this research not only defines Web3.0, but also determines the possible challenges, risks, and opportunities that are emerged from Web3.0 technology specifically in the tourism domain.

Hence, the motivation of this study is to design an auxiliary tri-generation system for a ship based on exhaust gases from its engine and implement the smart use technique of the waste heat. Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are conducted to evaluate the proposed system considering acceptable thermodynamic assumptions. The system consists of a Kalina cycle, an ejector-booster refrigeration cycle, and a humidification dehumidification desalination unit for power, cooling, and freshwater production. A parametric analysis is conducted to illustrate the effect of some design variables on the sum unit cost of products. Also, to achieve the best design of the system, different optimized cases are evaluated based on a genetic algorithm. According to the attained results, employing exhaust gases from a ship's engine through the proposed tri-generation system enhanced the thermodynamic and cost outcomes. So, this is a cost-effective and clean production solution to improve the design of a ship.

A Socio-Economic Proposed Theoretical Framework for Responding to The Covid-19 Outbreak,"[{""Penulis"":""Pangarso, Astadi""}]","One of the significant impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak was the need for physical distancing. Physical distancing causes changes in the order of human life within a relatively short amount of time. Physical distancing also directly causes various socio-economic problems, especially for small-medium enterprise (SME) businesses. The background of this research is the absence of a theoretical framework related to the socio-economic impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak based on previous quantitative research publications. This research aims to develop a theoretical framework on the socio-economic constructs for response to a Covid-19. This research uses the literature review method. The research publication data used for the literature review comes from the Scopus database until May 1, 2020, with restrictions to only quantitative research publication documents. The publication of quantitative research as research data is only derived from the business subject and uses quantitative data processing tools based on structural equation modelling (SEM) variance and covariance. From the research results, a theoretical framework was developed on the role of socio-economic moderation on the effect of internal resources on organizational performance and the role of socio-economics as an antecedent of environmental behaviour. The proposed theoretical framework has the potential to be empirically tested in a future-related socio-economic response to a Covid-19 outbreak. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The feasibility of the proposed cogeneration system is evaluated using exergy and thermal balance relations as the utmost productive tools. A comprehensive parametric evaluation is conducted, and it is found that the thermal and energetic performances of the unit can be maximized with adjusting separator 2 pressure. An accord with the performed parametric evaluation, it is discerned that the thermal efficiency of the devised electricity/cooling system can be enhanced with the booster pressure ratio and evaporator temperature. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the exergy efficiency improves with reducing the booster pressure ratio, condenser pressure, and evaporator temperature or rising separator 1 pressure. Later, the productivity of the suggested set-up is optimized by highlighting energy and exergy efficiencies. Considering energy and exergy efficiencies simultaneously in an optimization mode, it is found that the net generated electricity and exergy efficiency can be improved by 62.33% and 57.78%, respectively.

"Comfa, molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies on cycloguanil analogues as potent antimalarial agents","[{""Penulis"":""Kurniawan, Isman""},{""Penulis"":""Fareza, Muhamad Salman""},{""Penulis"":""Iswanto, Ponco""}]","Malaria is a disease that commonly infects humans in many tropical areas. This disease becomes a serious problem because of the high resistance of Plasmodium parasite against the well-established antimalarial agents, such as Artemisinin. Hence, new potent compounds are urgently needed to resolve this resistance problem. In the present study, we investigated cycloguanil analogues as a potent antimalarial agent by utilizing several studies, i.e., comparative of molecular field analysis (CoMFA), molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A CoMFA model with five partial least square regressions (PLSR) was developed to predict the pIC50 value of the compound by utilizing a data set of 42 cycloguanil analogues. From statistical analysis, we obtained the r2 values of the training and test sets that were 0.85 and 0.70, respectively, while q2 of the leave-one-out cross-validation was 0.77. The contour maps of the CoMFA model were also interpreted to analyze the structural requirement regarding electrostatic and steric factors. The most active compound (c33) and least active compound (c8) were picked for molecular docking and MD analysis. From the docking analysis, we found that the attached substituent on the backbone structure of cycloguanil gives a significant contribution to antimalarial activity. The results of the MD simulation confirm the stability of the binding pose obtained from the docking simulations. © 2021, Gadjah Mada University.

Air Quality Measurement Device Using Programmable Quadcopter Drone Towards Internet of Drone Things,"[{""Penulis"":""Karna, Nyoman""},{""Penulis"":""Lubna, Deriel Laska""},{""Penulis"":""Shin, Soo Young""}]","Air pollution is a condition in which air quality is damaged and contaminated either by harmful or harmless substances for living beings. That is the reason why smart cities monitor the air quality. However, the installation for air quality measurement system is mainly in an area where there is a lot of pollution from traffics. This research proposes air quality measurement system over the ground using programmable quadcopter drone towards Internet of Drone Things. The sensors used to measure the air quality are MQ-135 and DHT22. NodeMCU is used to process and send the measurement value to Firebase, which can be further monitored by smartphone in real time. Air quality measurement test was carried out in two places, location 1 is the one with quiet environment and surrounded by trees, and location 2 is a very busy place surrounded with construction sites, each with 3 different altitudes (0, 3, and 5 meters) and 4 different sampling time (09.00, 12.00, 16.00, and 21.00). The system shows that higher altitude (5 meters) gives better air quality index compared to on the ground measurement (0 meter).

This pandemic is increasingly exacerbating the burden on tropical and subtropical regions of the world due to the pre-existing dengue fever, which has become endemic for a longer period in the same region. Co-circulation dengue and COVID-19 cases have been found and confirmed in several countries. In this paper, a deterministic model for the coendemic of COVID-19 and dengue is proposed. The basic reproduction ratio is obtained, which is related to the four equilibria, disease-free, endemic-COVID-19, endemic-dengue, and coendemic equilibria. Stability analysis is done for the first three equilibria. Furthermore, a condition for coexistence equilibrium is obtained, which gives a condition for bifurcation analysis. Numerical simulations were carried out to obtain a stable limit-cycle resulting from two Hopf bifurcation points with dengue transmission rate and COVID-19 transmission rate as the bifurcation parameter, representing a stable periodic coexistence of dengue and COVID-19 transmission.

So far, local governments have experienced difficulties in measuring the implementation of information technology. In this paper, the measurement process is proposed through 2 stages, namely: stage 1 conducting an E-Readiness survey and assessment of the maturity level of ICT based on COBIT 5, and stage 2 looking for the correlation value between the data from the E-Readiness survey and ICT maturity level data. Measurements were carried out at DISKOMINFO Majalengka District as a representative of government units. The results of the E-Readiness survey stated that the readiness level reached 45% and the ICT maturity level reached 2.86 (managed level). Overall DISKOMINFO has shortcomings in various aspects assessed through the COBIT 5 standard. Meanwhile, based on the Pearson Correlation, a correlation value of 0.92 is obtained.

Performance Analysis on Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for Path Planning and Collision Avoidance in Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"[{""Penulis"":""Muntasha, Gholiyana""},{""Penulis"":""Karna, Nyoman""},{""Penulis"":""Shin, Soo Young""}]","With the rapid advancement of wireless communication, sensors, and battery technologies, Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used for traffic surveillance, and military application. Swarm UAVs, however, need to plan paths through the atmosphere, effectively preventing any collision that can occur when flying a multiple UAV simultaneously. This study proposes to design an anti-collision and a path planning system of swarm UAVs by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The ABC algorithm is an optimization method inspired by the foraging behavior of honeybees. The self-organization trait of honeybees enables them to coordinate themselves to create a global and local optimum. The proposed system, however, uses the ABC algorithm to optimize UAV's velocity, i.e., to reach its destination efficiently in the shortest path while avoiding collision among drones. The establishment of a constraint of a minimum acceptable distance among UAVs enables the algorithm to search for an alternative path in avoiding a collision. The simulation, however, reveals a successful convergence of a swarm UAVs towards a destination with no collision. During the trial with 12 and 20 drones, for instance, all UAVs successfully arrive at their goals with 0 potential collisions. However, during the test with 50 drones, there are 12 possible collisions. Once swarm drones reach their goal position at rest, the cluster will not overlap with other agents, as demonstrated in the visualization. Therefore, the ABC algorithm has satisfied the success criteria for this project and is suitable for swarm drone applications. © 2021 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Wind speeds are usually measured and predicted at lower heights, while modern wind turbines have hub heights of about 80–120 m. As per understanding, this is first attempt to analyze predictability of wind speed with height. To achieve this, wind data was collected using Laser Illuminated Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system at 10 m, 20 m, 40 m, 90 m, 120 m, 200 m, 250 m and 300 m heights. The collected data is used for training and testing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for hourly wind speed prediction for each of the future 12 hours, using 48 previous hourly values. Careful analyses of short term wind speed prediction at different heights and future hours show that wind speed is predicted more accurately at higher heights. For example, the mean absolute percent error decreases from 0.25 to 0.12 corresponding to heights 10 to 300 m, respectively for the 6th future hour prediction, an improvement of around 50%. The performance of ANN method is compared with hybrid genetic algorithm and ANN method namely GANN. Results showed that GANN outperformed ANN for most of the heights for prediction of wind speed at the future 6th hour.

However, further investigations are required regarding the interaction between these phenomena on rainfall pattern. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the interaction between MJO and CS over western Indonesia, particularly by using land-based rainfall observation data from multiple stations, as previous studies were dominated by the use of gridded data from remote observations. This study utilized in-situ observation data obtained from 4329 weather observations and rain stations between 1989 and 2018. Subsequently, quality control performed based on data availability exceeding 70% over a 30-year period resulted in 303 selected stations to be used for further analysis. Meanwhile, the RMM index, as well as reanalysis data of mean sea level pressure and 925 hPa meridional wind, were also applied for MJO and CS identification. According to the composite analysis, the effect of CS on MJO phases tends to increase precipitation by about 50%, over western Indonesia, with maximum increase ranging from 200 to 400% over the northeastern coast of Sumatra, around Karimata Strait (Riau Islands and West Kalimantan), as well as the northern coast of Java. These areas are exposed to the sea and have direct access to the wind-terrain interaction. In addition, the highest rainfall anomaly due to the MJO-CS interaction occurs around Karimata Strait, followed by northern Sumatra and Java, with spatially averaged rainfall anomaly reaching 5 mm/day over the area. © 2021 by the authors.

The system generates power, cooling, and desalinated water embracing a Kalina cycle in integration with an ejector refrigeration cycle and a humidification dehumidification-based desalination. A parametric study is conducted to analyze the influence of variation in some design parameters on the system's performance. The results indicates that both energy and exergy efficiencies enhance as separator pressure, vapor generator terminal temperature difference and condenser temperature decrease, and evaporator temperature increase. Additionally, Ammonia concentration in the Ammonia–water mixture is seen to have opposing effects on efficiencies. The desalinated water production rate reaches a maximum value of 1.34 kg/s when the Ammonia concentration is equal to 22–23%. Moreover, this parameter declines as the separator pressure increases, and remains unchanged when the evaporator temperature varies. As for cooling, it is deduced that augmentations in separator pressure, evaporator temperature, and vapor generator terminal temperature difference contribute to improvements in cooling output. In a regular input situation, energy and exergy efficiencies, net output power, cooling, and desalinated water production rate are found to be 60.4%, 39.7%, 559.8 kW, 604.7 kW, and 1.31 kg/s, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Savings behaviour of bottom income group: Is there any role for financial efficacy and risk preference?,"[{""Penulis"":""Muhamad, Suriyani""},{""Penulis"":""Kusairi, Suhal""},{""Penulis"":""Zamri, Nadia""}]","An immense concern of governments globalwide today is financial inclusion as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Governments arrive at many solutions by addressing the policies to improve financial achievement, mainly through financial education programmes and specifically personal finance. Yet, financial management has such a broad scope and is not limited to just knowledge and financial literacy. Individuals are born with different confidence levels and non-identical financial abilities. This study investigates financial self-efficacy by applying psychometric instruments, risk preference and demography characteristics towards saving decision behaviour. The sample in the survey consisted of 479 respondents in Peninsular Malaysia that then became subject to structural equation modelling. The results show that financial self-efficacy is one of the critical factors that explain individual saving decision behaviour. Also, risk preference, gender and area (rural or urban) determine the saving decision behaviour.

IRE uses non-thermal electric pulses to induce death of cancerous cells. However, recent studies have shown that the application of this technique may result in heating of the tissue. There is still room for improving its efficiency and defining better treatment protocols. This study investigates the optimal IRE protocols that avoiding the thermal damage during the IRE treatment. Methods: Electrode and pulse parameter are investigated. Finite element models are created to evaluate the ablation area and the temperature changes in the tissue. The model is validated experimentally in bovine liver tissue, while the parameters were optimized using response surface method (RSM). Results: From analysis of variance, the parameter of electrode distance and input voltage has significant effect to the temperature rise in the IRE treatment of bovine liver (P = 0.020 and P = 0.003 respectively). Meanwhile, only the input voltage significantly affects the ablation area (P < 0.001). The optimal result from RSM showed that for maximum ablation area 250.82mm2 with no thermal damage, the IRE protocol consisted of an active electrode length of 10 mm, a distance between electrodes of 10 mm, and the delivery of 50 pulses of 41.21 µs and 3000 V. Conclusions: The approach presented in this study allows the optimization of the IRE protocols. An optimal IRE protocol that maximizes the ablation area was successfully calculated which can be applied with no risk of thermal damage to the tissue. © 2021, The Author(s).","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
The Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility and Higher Academic Education Expert on Audit Opinion in Light of The Company Profile Perspective,"[{""Penulis"":""Cahyaningsih""},{""Penulis"":""Lestari, Tri Utami""}]","Audit of operational standards on how to evaluate social programs is a hotly debated topic and also higher academic education. The role of expert audit opinion is becoming increasingly important in terms of supporting a company's reputation. This study aims to determine the effect of corporate social performance and higher academic education on audit opinion. This study used the cost of corporate social responsibility to determine the corporate social performance. The audit opinion assessed in this paper was a going concern audit opinion. The companies referred to in this study were high-profile, low-profile companies, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and Privately-Owned Enterprises (POEs). This study examined 583 observation-years of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2018 period. This study found that there was a negative effect of social performance on going-concern audit opinion. The finding showed that the auditors had doubts about the viability of the business of the company with low social performance. This evidence was found in high-profile and low-profile companies, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), as well as Privately-Owned Enterprises (POEs). High-profile and low-profile companies, SOEs, and POEs are expected to always strive to increase social and environmental awareness. Superior social performance is usually associated with lower regulatory risks, litigation, and external reputation for both the client company and the auditor. Superior social performance also signified ethical and responsible management. On the other hand, higher academic education also played a significant and positive role with the audit opinion. This study provides evidence regarding the effect of social performance on the assessment of audit risk to decide the audit opinion to be determined by the auditor. © 2021 RIGEO.

Multi-parameter Coordinated Public School Admission Model by using Stable Marriage,"[{""Penulis"":""Kusuma, Purba Daru""}]","School admission is a very important process in improving the education quality. Meanwhile, one problem in the school admission system is the mismatch. There are unassigned applicants and unallocated seats. In Indonesia, zone-based model is adopted in the public-school admission system. Students are assigned to their nearest school. Besides location, student’s academic performance and economic level are also concerned. Based on it, this work proposes coordinated public school admission model that accommodates flexible number of the concerned parameters. It is built based on the stable marriage algorithm or the deferred-acceptance algorithm as its derivative. The proposed model is a combination between the mandatory approach and the school choice approach. The concerned parameters are school-home distance, student national exam score, school rank, applicant poor status, and applicant’s preference. The simulation is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed model compared with the previous models: the zone-based model and the two-step model. The prioritization of the concerned parameters is proven easily adjusted. The simulation result shows that in the over-demand condition, the proposed model creates higher average student national exam score and higher average school-home distance rather than the previous models. When the number of applicants is twice of the number of seats, the proposed model creates 6.6 percent higher in the average student national exam score and 71.4 percent higher in the average school-home distance. The simulation result also shows that the mismatch is solved. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

However, Indonesia's national beef supply cannot meet those needs. The import of beef in large numbers likely to remain performed. The government has made various efforts to reduce imports and achieve self-sufficiency in beef. However, the government does not yet have a good identification, registration, documentation, and traceability system, so there is no truly valid data regarding the actual stock condition. Inaccuracy of data can lead to inappropriate policymaking in the livestock sector. Therefore, an e-Government initiative in the form of e-Livestock has been proposed. The definitions and success factors regarding e-Livestock have been revealed in our previous researches. Based on those researches, by using soft system methodology, hermeneutics, focus group discussion, and success factors, the business process models for e-Livestock in Indonesia will be created in this research. Apart from that, various kinds of recommendations for action to solve the problem will also be generated from this research. Those recommendations are about the functional requirement, the identification tool, the location numbering rule, the ownership documentation, the socialization of the e-Livestock, the institutional aspect of e-Livestock, the regulations underlie e-Livestock and the conceptual infrastructure diagram of e-Livestock.

Implementation of machine learning methods for monitoring and predicting water quality parameters,"[{""Penulis"":""Hayder, Gasim""},{""Penulis"":""Kurniawan, Isman""},{""Penulis"":""Mustafa, Hauwa Mohammed""}]","The importance of good water quality for human use and consumption can never be underestimated, and its quality is determined through effective monitoring of the water quality index. Different approaches have been employed in the treatment and monitoring of water quality parameters (WQP). Presently, water quality is carried out through laboratory experiments, which requires costly reagents, skilled labor, and consumes time. Thereby making it necessary to search for an alternative method. Recently, machine learning tools have been successfully implemented in the monitoring, estimation, and predictions of river water quality index to provide an alternative solution to the limitations of laboratory analytical methods. In this study, the potentials of one of the machine learning tools (artificial neural network) were explored in the predictions and estimation of the Kelantan River basin. Water quality data collected from the 14 stations of the River basin was used for modeling and predicting (WQP). As for WQP analysis, the results obtained from this study show that the best prediction was obtained from the prediction of pH. The low kurtosis values of pH indicate that the appearance of outliers give a negative impact on the performance. As for WQP analysis for each station, we found that the WQP prediction in station 1, 2, and 3 give the good results. This is related to the available data of those stations that are more than the available data in other stations, except station 8. © 2020 by the authors.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Weights-Based Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Network Protocol with Firefly Synchronization for Illegal Logging,"[{""Penulis"":""Mutiara, Giva Andriana""},{""Penulis"":""Mohd, Othman""},{""Penulis"":""Suryana, Nanna""},{""Penulis"":""Pee, Ahmad Naim Che""}]",": An effort to minimize illegal logging by utilizing advanced technology such as Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are highly required. WSN is a communication solution between remote sensors located in isolated wide forest areas. However, the WSN challenge in a remote and wide-area has the energy resources limitation. This research proposed a weights-based energy-efficient WSN data communication protocol with firefly synchronization, namely Firefly Synchronization Multi-hop - Geographical Energy-Aware Routing (FSM-GEAR) Protocol. This protocol aimed to increase the network lifetime of each node by shortening the transmission distance. Firefly synchronization between sensors is conducted to reduce the data transmission waiting time. A weights-based approach in cluster head (CH) selection phases and energy consumption analysis are formulated according to the comparison between nearest distance to Gateway and the maximum residual energy of each node based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Weights-based FSM-GEAR performance analysis is carried out based on the parameters of network lifetime, residual energy, and throughput with the Modified-GEAR and enhanced Modified-GEAR protocols as a comparison. The simulation result stated that FSM-GEAR protocol showed better network lifetime, residual energy, and throughput than both protocols. © 2021.

First-Degree Polynomial Gradient Approach to Reveal the Severity of COVID-19 Pandemic in Affected Countries,"[{""Penulis"":""Wijaya, Dedy Rahman""},{""Penulis"":""Agung, Anak Agung Gde""},{""Penulis"":""Fahrudin, Tora""},{""Penulis"":""Suryatiningsih S.""}]","COVID-19 is a new type of Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which originated from Wuhan in China. Since 11 March 2020, WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Currently, it has spread to 175 countries or regions around the world. From day to day, confirmed, recovered and death cases have been reported. This data rapidly changes that indicates an uncertain situation. This uncertain situation might affect many social-economic activities. However, until now, there is no approach to categorize these countries in conjunction with the latest situation. The typical measure, for example, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is used to measure the proportion of deaths compared to the total number of confirmed from a certain disease. It utilizes for diseases with discrete, limited-time courses, such as outbreaks of acute infections. The major drawback of CFR is it can only be considered as a final result when all the cases have been accomplished (either died or recovered). According to this gap, we proposed the first-degree polynomial or linear gradient approach to categorize the COVID-19 severity status of areas or countries based on the rate of confirmed, recovered and death cases. The status categorization is necessary information for all parties to be aware of the situation. It can be used for consideration to determine policies related to COVID-19 pandemic such as travel warning, self-isolation, work from home, lock-down, etc. © 2021 Dedy Rahman Wijaya, Anak Agung Gde Agung, Tora Fahrudin and Suryatiningsih.

Empirical mode decomposition and grey level difference for lung sound classification,"[{""Penulis"":""Hadiyoso, Sugondo""},{""Penulis"":""Rizal, Achmad""}]","Lung sound is one of the parameters of respiratory health. This sound has a specific character if there is a disease in the lungs. In some cases, it is difficult to distinguish one type of lung sound to another. It takes the expertise, experience and sensitivity of clinicians to avoid misdiagnosis. Therefore, many studies have proposed a feature extraction method combined with automatic classification method for the detection of lung disease through lung sound analysis. Since the complex nature of biological signals which are produced by complex processes, the multiscale method is an interesting feature extraction method to be developed. This study proposes an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a modified gray level difference (GLD) for a lung sound classification. The EMD was used to decompose the signal, and then GLD was measured on each decomposed signal as a feature set. There are five classes of lung sounds which were simulated in this study, including normal, wheeze, crackle, pleural rub, and stridor. Performance evaluation was carried out using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 3-fold cross-validation. This proposed method yielded the highest accuracy of 96.97%. This study outperformed several previous studies which were simulated on the same dataset. It is hoped that in the future, the proposed methods can be tested on larger datasets to determine the robustness of the methods. © 2021 Lavoisier.

Air Pressure Control on Ventilator using Fuzzy Logic Method,"[{""Penulis"":""Amaranggana, Alya""},{""Penulis"":""Priramadhi, Rizki""}]","In a virus outbreak that attacks human respiration, there is an increase in the need for ventilators that is not proportional to their availability. A ventilator is a device that serves to assist or replace normal ventilation functions in people who have respiratory problems. The lungs are important organs in the respiratory system. The lungs can inflate if the atmospheric pressure is greater than the lung pressure (Palv). Conversely, the lungs can deflate if the atmospheric pressure is less than Palv. In the process of inspiration, air flows from outside to the alveoli, increasing oxygen levels. The faster oxygen is introduced into the alveoli from the atmosphere, the higher the oxygen concentration in the alveoli. So that the oxygen concentration in the alveoli is controlled by the speed with which new oxygen enters the lungs through the ventilation process. In people who have respiratory problems, the body is less able to supply the oxygen needs of the lungs so that the flow of air pressure that flows into the lungs must be controlled. A ventilator is made with the principle of pressure difference. Atmospheric pressure is set greater than Palv so that air enters the lungs. In contrast, atmospheric pressure is set to be less than Palv to force air out of the lungs. The outside air pressure can be increased by providing positive pressure air from the airflow drive device. With the Fuzzy Logic control method, the speed of the airflow drive device is adjusted to meet the patient's needs. Ventilators that have been designed and manufactured can provide air pressure in the pressure range of 0 to +50 cmH2O or the equivalent of 0 to 0.711167 psi. The basic pressure at the end of the breath is set to be equal to atmospheric pressure.  © 2021 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

To achieve this, wind data was collected using Laser Illuminated Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system at 20m, 40m, 50m, 60m, 80m, 100m, 120m, 140m, 160m, and 180m heights. This hourly averaged data is used for training and testing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the prediction of wind speed for each of the future 12 hours, using 48 previous values. Detailed analyses of short-term wind speed prediction at different heights and future hours show that wind speed is predicted more accurately at higher heights.For example, the mean absolute percent error decreases from 0.19 to 0.16as the height increase from 20m to 180m, respectively for the 12th future hour prediction. The performance of the proposed method is compared with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) method. Results show that RNN performed better than MLP for most of the cases presented here at the future 6th hour. © Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Belgrade.

Detection of Disease in Citrus Plants through Leaf Images using a Convolutional Neural Network,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramadhan, Muhamad Ikhsan""},{""Penulis"":""Suyanto, Suyanto""}]","Citrus is one of the most commonly consumed fruits by humans due to its delicious taste and vitamin C. For citrus plant cultivators, it is crucial to recognize the problem early so that it does not interfere with citrus plant growth or even prevent citrus plant death. Creating a computer-based application that automatically recognizes citrus plant diseases will be more manageable for farmers to eradicate immediately. In this paper, a recognition model of citrus plant diseases is developed using a CNN to classify the disease of citrus leave images into four classes: Blackspot, Cancer, Greening, and Healthy. This dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website. An evaluation using the 5-fold crossvalidation for a dataset of 600 image data of citrus leaves shows that the developed model gives an accuracy of 95,6%.

Microarray data classification using minimum redundancy maximum relevance and modified logistic regression for high accuracy cancer detection,"[{""Penulis"":""Khoirunnisa, Azka""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""}]","Microarray data technology is one of the popular techniques for cancer de-tection, where thousands of gene expressions can be read at the same time. However, one of the well-known constraints specifically related to microarray data is the large number of genes that cause high dimensional data in comparison with the small number of avail- A ble experiments or cases. This will give lower classification accuracy. Some popular approaches have been introduced, and one of them is a combination of Principal Com-ponent Analysis (PCA) and Logistic Regression to overcome the issues.

While the practice of CSR is expected to promote economic and social development, CSR practices in extractives sector, especially in developing countries, invites debates from stakeholders. The debates are mostly related to the negative image of the extractives sectors in harming the environment and exploiting local people. From the corporation side, debates are related to what kinds of CSR the community desires and how much money corporations for their CSR activities spend. This chapter explores the practice of CSR in the extractives sector in Indonesia, where the extractives sector has been the backbone of the economy for years. It starts with some reviews on the extractives sector and its operations in Indonesia, then the best and worst experiences in CSR practices in the extractives sector, and finally provides the main challenges that the extractives sector is facing and strategies to overcome those challenges. This chapter concludes that CSR practices in the extractives sector are sometimes performed to minimize the negative image of the industries.

Generally, chemotherapy can be evaluated in various ways, phsychal examination, radiology examination, and laboratory examination. This study aims is to examine if the measurement of the platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be used to predict a patient's response to chemotherapy. Methods: Analytic observational study with a case-control design conducted in the Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung from 2017 to 2018. This study used the medical record of ovarian cancer patients with post-surgery complete blood counts and histopathological reports. The sample size was determined based on the categorical test's statistical calculation to obtain a total number of at minimal 90 samples. All the study subjects who had undergone complete chemotherapy were followed up for 6 months. Their response to chemotherapy was assessed with a clinical examination, ultrasonography, and a CA-125 blood test every 3 months. Results: In 2017-2018, 504 patients were diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung, Indonesia. After reassessment, 116 patients had stage I to III ovarian cancer and underwent cytoreduction followed by platinum chemotherapy. The age, cancer stage, and types of epithelial cells in the platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients were characterized. There were significant differences between the two groups in age and cancer stage characteristics (p < 0.05). The increase in platelet/lymphocyte (p = 0.003) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios (p = 0.026) are associated with the increase in the response to platinum chemotherapy against epithelium-based cancers. Conclusion: A patient's NLR and PLR are strongly associated with his response to chemotherapy. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

IDC can spread to other areas of the body such as liver, lungs and even bones. The process of identifying and categorizing breast cancer sub-types accurately is a very important clinical task. IDC Diagnosis requires extremely serious measures, such as surgery and radiation therapy. Diagnosis based on pathological imagery is no less difficult, requiring a microscope and manual learning to classify it as positive or negative cancer. This process is very time consuming and conveys many errors due to human cognitive limitations. The existence of a system which can automatically perform such work, is expected to save time and reduce the error rate diagnose. This study proposed IDC and Non IDC classification by analyzing the Breast Histopathology Images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. The dataset consisted of 1020 IDC images, the same number is also used for Non-IDC. The model was composed of CNN with three hidden layers plus one fully connected layer with sigmoid activation. An evaluation is carried out to see the performance of the proposed method by using a matrix of precision, recall, F1, and accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides precision, recall, F1-score of 0.93 and 93% accuracy.

Comparative analysis of ReliefF-SVM and CFS-SVM for microarray data classification,"[{""Penulis"":""Hakim, Mochamad Agusta Naofal""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""},{""Penulis"":""Astuti, Widi""}]","Cancer is one of the main causes of death in the world where the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized cancer as among the top causes of death in 2018. Thus, detecting cancer symptoms is paramount in order to cure and subsequently reduce the casualties due to cancer disease. Many studies have been developed data mining approaches to detect symptoms of cancer through a classifying human gene data expression. One popular approach is using microarray data based on DNA. However, DNA microarray data has many dimensions that can have a detrimental effect on the accuracy of classification. Therefore, before performing classification, a feature selection technique must be used to eliminate features that do not have important information to support the classification process. The feature selection techniques used were ReliefF and correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and a classification technique used in this study is support vector machine (SVM). Several testing schemes were applied in this analysis to compare the performance of ReliefF and CFS with SVM.

Hate Speech Detection in Indonesian Twitter Texts using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit,"[{""Penulis"":""Marpaung, Angela""},{""Penulis"":""Rismala, Rita""},{""Penulis"":""Nurrahmi, Hani""}]","As the number of social media users rises, the probability of hate speech spread in social media also rises indirectly. Hate speech has become one of most common cases found on social media. The spread of hate speech can lead to a riot that might cause conflict, group extermination, and even human casualties. Some of the latest controversies in Indonesia related to hate speech was the hate speech uttered to the government that led to polemic and even demonstration in the country. Along with this, it is important to detect hate speech to avoid conflict to happen. As the spread of hate speech in social media increases, it requires significant human efforts and is costly to detect manually. Therefore, this experiment is built to detect hate speech detection in Indonesian twitter texts using several conventional machine learning and deep learning based, BiGRU, with various features. The machine learning approaches being used are SVM and RFDT, while deep learning based methods used are BiGRU and pre-Trained IndoBERT with BiGRU. Several methods used are Word2vec and fastText. The experiment shows that BiGRU method with IndoBERT and no stop word removal achieves the best performance with 84.77% accuracy. BiGRU has advantages on storing important information from text, thus making a better result than conventional machine learning algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Medical records of COVID-19 patients have been reported and analyzed worldwide. The Health Agency of Jakarta, Indonesia, collected clinical symptoms, demographics, travel history, and mortality information from March 2020 up to now. Despite massive research on COVID-19 patients' data, the significant clinical symptoms that lead to COVID-19 mortality in Jakarta have not been well described to the best of the authors' knowledge. We extracted the COVID-19 records in Jakarta and compared them between patients who were discharged and deceased. This paper examines each clinical symptom's importance to mortality using machine learning techniques, namely weighted Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. We observed that Pneumonia, Shortness of Breath, Malaise, Hypertension, Fever, and Runny Nose are the top six significant clinical symptoms that lead to deaths in Jakarta. We suggest medical experts become more cautious with these symptoms. Also, in medical facilities, these symptoms can be used as prescreening before entering the facilities. © 2021 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Preliminary assessment for sub-seasonal to seasonal precipitation model on four specific conditions over western Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Vivi, Agita""},{""Penulis"":""Hidayat, Rahmat""},{""Penulis"":""Faqih, Akhmad""},{""Penulis"":""Alfahmi, Furqon""}]","Preliminary assessment of sub-seasonal to seasonal reforecast precipitation model (S2S) was conducted to analyze the model's performance over western Indonesia on four conditions. The ECMWF S2S model was compared to quality controlled daily precipitation data from 645 observation points over the region. The control and perturbed model for the first three time steps and the last three were utilized to obtain the best performance comparison. The analysis was conducted in monthly period, MJO events, NCS events, and when both of them were active during period of November-December-January-February (NDJF) from 1998 to 2017. The results show that the first three time steps perform much better than the last one with a slightly higher correlation coefficient from the control model with relatively similar RMSE in Natuna Islands. Spatial analysis indicates that both of the control and perturbed models can catch the variation brought by the wet season in the NDJF period, by the MJO, show a hint of NCS effect, and the combination when MJO and NCS were active at the same time. The models can depict the precipitation pattern pretty well with the tendency to overestimate low rainfall intensity and underestimate the high one. The models relatively overestimate the intensity in Sumatra for the whole period. Meanwhile, consistently good spatial performance is shown by the models over Java, both in NDJF periods or MJO events. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Abundance and distribution of microplastics in Baturusa watershed of Bangka Belitung Islands Province,"[{""Penulis"":""Riskiana R.""},{""Penulis"":""Hariyadi S.""},{""Penulis"":""Effendi H.""}]","Microplastics has been found in the most water bodies since 1970s, yet its presence and understanding about the existence on the freshwater body, as well as a control upon its abundance is still very limited. Whereas the river became a very potential channel for microplastics in contaminating the environment. Microplastics is term refer to plastic particles which diameter less than 5 mm. Microplastics could act as an absorbent of chemicals from the environment, and also a carrier of additive chemicals added during the process of plastic manufacturing to the organisms. It can potentially affect the organisms through the aquatic food web. This study aims to figure out the abundance and distribution of microplastics in Baturusa watershed. The research was carried out from November 2019 to August 2020. Samples were collected using plankton net of 30µm mesh size, from seven sites represent upstream, downstream, and tributaries, then analyzed using an ocular microscope. The microplastics particles type found are sheets, films, fibers, and fragments. The average microplastics abundance was 2209-5569 particles m-3, the highest abundance was found in Rangkui River estuary about 5647 particles m-3, and the lowest was in Selindung River. This reveals that the more abundance of microplastics in the waters was correlated to the more human activities surroundings. © 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

Iris-based image processing for cholesterol level detection using gray level co-occurrence matrix and support vector machine,"[{""Penulis"":""Daniel, Melvin""},{""Penulis"":""Raharjo, Jangkung""},{""Penulis"":""Usman, Koredianto""}]","Serious illnesses such as strokes and heart attacks can be triggered by high levels of cholesterol in human blood that exceeds ideal conditions, where the ideal cholesterol level is below 200 mg/dL. To find out cholesterol levels need a long process because the patient must go through a blood sugar test that requires the patient to undergo fasting for 10–12 hours first before the test. Iridology is a branch of science that studies human iris and its relation to the wellness of human internal organs. The method can be used as an alternative for medical analysis. Iridology thus can be used to assess the conditions of organs, body construction, and other psychological conditions. This paper proposes a cholesterol detection system based on the iris image processing using Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). GLCM is used as the feature extraction method of the image, while SVM acts as the classifier of the features. In addition to GLCM and SVM, this paper also construct a preprocessing method which consist of image resizing, segmentation, and color image to gray level conversion of the iris image. These steps are necessary before the GLCM feature extraction step can be applied. In principle, the GLCM method is a construction of a matrix containing the information about the proximity position of gray level images pixels. The output of GLCM is fed to the SVM that relies on the best hyperplane. Thus, SVM performs as a separator of two data classes of the input space. From the simulation results, the system built was able to detect excess cholesterol levels through iris image and classify into three classes, namely: non– cholesterol (< 200 mg/dL), risk of cholesterol (200–239 mg/dL) and high cholesterol (> 240 mg/dL).

Improved Residual Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification,"[{""Penulis"":""Erwandi, Reynold""},{""Penulis"":""Suyanto, Suyanto""}]","Breast cancer is one of the most dangerous types of cancer, especially for women. In 2015, it became the deadliest cancer after lung cancer in America. Some studies found that both self-detection and prevention are important factors in dealing with this cancer. The process of diagnosing breast cancer traditionally takes a long time. Moreover, pathologists are not 100% sure of the results of their diagnosis. Therefore, in this research, a computer-aided system is developed to help doctors to classify cell types based on histopathological images.

Recycling of Wood Saw Dust Waste as Green Pore Forming Agent for Porous Ceramic,"[{""Penulis"":""Zakaria, Siti Koriah""},{""Penulis"":""Hakim Md Zulkifli, Muhammad Luqman""},{""Penulis"":""Azhar Taib, Mustaffa Ali""},{""Penulis"":""Budiman, Faisal""},{""Penulis"":""Mohamed, Mazlan""},{""Penulis"":""Ali, Arlina""},{""Penulis"":""Yusoff, Abdul Hafidz""},{""Penulis"":""Teo, Pao Ter""}]","Porous ceramic fabrication using natural pore forming agents have received more and more attention in the past few years. However, researchers have encountered an issue with an inconsistent particle size, which led to uneven pore distribution. Considering waste material as pore forming agent, this research seeks to explore the potential application of wood sawdust in porous ceramic production. Moreover, the effects of wood sawdust weight percentage (wt.%) and firing temperature towards the physical and mechanical properties of porous ceramic will also be investigated. Porous ceramic was fabricated by introducing two different proportions of wood sawdust (10 and 20 wt.%) into China clay, followed by drying at 110°C and firing at 900°C. The characterization analyses were performed by means of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, water absorption, apparent porosity, bulk density, and X-Ray Diffraction. The results showed that the compressive strength appears to decrease as the composition of the waste wood sawdust increases. Relatively, the water absorption value increases as the wood sawdust incorporation increased. This is because more porosity formation is observed at a higher sawdust ratio, leading to a lower density of the ceramic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

This infection is characterized by the appearance of rashes all over the body and potentially cause serious complications, especially among infants and children. Before measles immunization was promoted, it is one of the endemic diseases that caused the most fatalities each year in the world. This paper aims to analyze and to investigate measles transmission in Jakarta via an SIHR epidemic model involving vaccination from January to December 2017. Jakarta Health Office collected the observed data of measles incidence. We then derived the basic reproduction number as a threshold of disease transmission and obtained the local as well as global stability of the equilibria under certain conditions. The unobserved parameters and initial conditions were estimated by minimizing errors between data and numerical results. Furthermore, a stochastic model was developed to capture the data and to accommodate the randomness of the transmission. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to analyze and to identify the parameters which give significant contributions to the spread of the virus. We then obtained simulations of vaccine level coverage. The data is shown within a 95% confidence interval of the stochastic solutions, and the average of the stochastic solutions is relatively close to the solution of the deterministic model. The most sensitive parameter in the infected compartment is the hospitalized rate, which can be considered to be one of the essential factors to reduce the number of cases for policymakers. We hence proposed a control strategy which is providing treatment accesses easier for infected individuals is better than vaccinating when an outbreak occurs. © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Governments explore solutions addressing policies to improve financial literacy. Nevertheless, financial management has such a broad scope and is not just limited to knowledge. As human nature, individuals are born with different confidence levels that include various financial abilities. This study aims to investigate the household-financial efficacy through the application of psychometric instruments, risk preference, and demographic characteristics toward consumption decision behavior. The research is based on a survey 479 households in the peninsular Malaysia, and utilizes the structural equation model, cluster proportional and systematic random sampling, and two measurements-composite reliability and average variance extracted. Results show that households' financial efficacy is one of the critical factors that explain the households' consumption decision behavior. Also, risk preference, gender and area location (rural or urban) of the household determined the consumption decision behavior of the household. The effectiveness of consumption decision is not only determined by financial literacy, but also financial efficacy. The implications of this paper may help to design policies in narrowing the broad gap between the rural and urban level of financial efficacy.

It is reported that almost 6.7 million visitors come to Bandung in 2018, and the number increased by almost 4% per year since 2014. This rise in the number of visitors leads to the establishment of several toll gates as main access points throughout the city. As one of the busiest ones, Buah Batu toll gate is frequently congested because of the location that is close to the southern part of Bandung. To overcome this problem, a traffic regulation based on computer simulation is urgently required. In this study, we simulate the traffic system on the Buah Batu toll gate by using a combination of Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) and Daoudia and Moussa (DM) models. NaSch model was used to defined vehicle movement, while the DM model was used to allow a vehicle to change lane. We defined three scenarios to evaluate the effectivity of the closing gate scheme.

Performance Evaluation of Radio Resource Allocation Algorithm for 5G Device-to-Device Communication Underlying on 4G LTE Networks,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramadhan, Mohamad Yasin""},{""Penulis"":""Nashiruddin, Muhammad Imam""}]","One of the advanced features of 5G technology is the Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, which capable of serving peer to peer communication, and D2D pair can communicate directly without having to pass through the Base Transceiver Station by re-using the frequency spectrum (resource) from the cellular user. D2D communication led to significant interference on mobile networks when sharing radio resources, and precise radio resource allocation requires algorithms to reduce interference. This study aims to evaluate the most optimal radio resource allocation algorithm of 5G D2D communication underlying on a 4G LTE network using heuristic algorithms, minimum interference algorithms, and random allocation algorithms. Each algorithm tested with the scenario that involved variations of the cell radius distance, the value of data rate, fairness, and energy efficiency to determine the most optimal algorithm. The result shows that the higher amount of cell radius distance in a system makes the value of the system's data rate, fairness, and energy efficiency smaller because the gain on the device in the system also becomes smaller. Heuristic algorithms were having better data rates and energy efficiency compared to other algorithms. Therefore, it is suitable to be used when the level of system complexity is high. However, it works less optimally when a system has a vast cell radius because the heuristic algorithm's performance value tends to decrease with a more significant difference at each increase. © 2020 IEEE.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Design of Open Loop Single Axis Solar Tracker System,"[{""Penulis"":""Rinaldi, Rizal""},{""Penulis"":""Aprillia, Bandiyah Sri""},{""Penulis"":""Ekaputri, Cahyantari""},{""Penulis"":""Reza, Muhamad""}]","The amount of power output in a solar power system depends on the intensity of solar radiation. The earth's movements however cause changes in the intensity of solar radiation received by solar panels on the daily. Therefore, the implementation of a controller that can track the position of the sun (solar tracker) is believed to increase the power output of solar panels. This research focuses on the design of a photovoltaic panel drive system using an Android-based application as a monitoring media. The application is used to monitor the current temperature and provide a desired angle input. Based on the test results, the average power output of a fixed PV reached only 17.15 Watt, while on a single axis PV, average output reached 21.50 Watt. It can be concluded that in the single axis PV, average power output increased by more than 25% compared to the fixed PV.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The prediction is usually obtained by using traditional semiempirical methods and numerical approaches by using wave models. In this paper, we use a soft computing approach for predicting wave condition, i.e. the Support Vector Regression (SVR), based on wind information as input for the regression model. Because of the limitation of wind and wave measurement data, here we use wind data obtained from the ECMWF ERA-5 and wave simulated data based on the SWAN model, as training data for the SVR model. As a study case, we choose an area with rather complex geometry and bathymetry, i.e. an archipelago country consisting of small islands; the Jakarta Bay, in Indonesia.

One of the steps towards sustainable tea production is survey and identification. The process continues with the selection of suitable planting material (seedlings). Gambung series, are planting material seeds that have been recommended by the Indonesia Ministry of Agriculture. The Gambung series has a potential yield of 4.000-5.800 kg/hectare of dried tea. The morphological similarity level of Gambung series is very high, because the elders of the clones are from the same crossing parents. Experts who are able to identify Gambung clone are very limited. This process is susceptible to errors and is very dependent on the presence of experts. If an error occurs in the process of identifying the type of clone, it will interferes with the breeding process. Errors in the selection of recommended clones will be detrimental to the process for long time period, due to the economic age of the tea plant can reach 50 years.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 4508 cases from the U.K. Biobank were split randomly into 3244 training cases, 812 validation cases, and 452 test cases. Ground truth myocardial landmarks were defined and tracked by manual initialization and correction of deformable image registration using previously validated software with five readers. The fully automatic framework consisted of (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN) for localization and (b) a combination of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a CNN to detect and track the myocardial landmarks through the image sequence for each slice. Radial and circumferential strain were then calculated from the motion of the landmarks and averaged on a slice basis. Results: Within the test set, myocardial end-systolic circumferential Green strain errors were 20.001 ± 0.025, 20.001 ± 0.021, and 0.004 ± 0.035 in the basal, mid-, and apical slices, respectively (mean ± standard deviation of differences between predicted and manual strain). The framework reproduced significant reductions in circumferential strain in participants with diabetes, hypertensive participants, and participants with a previous heart attack. Typical processing time was approximately 260 frames (approximately 13 slices) per second on a GPU with 12 GB RAM compared with 6–8 minutes per slice for the manual analysis. Conclusion: The fully automated combined RNN and CNN framework for analysis of myocardial strain enabled unbiased strain evaluation in a high-throughput workflow, with similar ability to distinguish impairment due to diabetes, hypertension, and previous heart attack. © Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

This worldwide pandemic has damaged not only human health but also created an economic and social crisis. Indonesia is no exception. Unfortunately, an analysis of a mixed-method survey of 500 participants found that public perception of transparency in the government’s release of COVID-19 information is still at a low level. This perceived low level of transparency generates minimum trust in the information. Only 8% of participants trust the government’s information regarding the virus. Even though the Indonesian government launched an official website, www.covid19.go.id, which is intended as a primary source of valid information about COVID-19 in Indonesia, most survey participants had never used the website. However, contrary to the low levels of perceived transparency and trust, most participants said that the messages from the government are clear and easy to understand. This contradiction resulted from skepticism toward the government.

Combination of program evaluation and review technique (PERT) and critical path method (CPM) for project schedule development,"[{""Penulis"":""Baits, Hamzah Abdul""},{""Penulis"":""Puspita, Ika Arum""},{""Penulis"":""Bay, Achmad Fuad""}]","One of the problems faced by the contractors is an inappropriate scheduling method. For project scheduling, the contractor using Bar chart. Although this method still can be used, but in its application is limited to scheduling large-scale projects, because this method cannot describe the interdependence of activity. The problem can be solved using Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and Critical Path Method (CPM). PERT is a method that can be used to estimate the duration of activity and can calculate the probability of project time completion, while CPM is a scheduling method used to find the path of critical path and can describe the relationship between activities. Scheduling results using CPM found that the minimum duration to complete the project was 135 days with 20 activities on the critical path with 50% project probability. Further analysis using PERT found that for a greater probability of the project completion was 68% for 139.78 days duration, 95% for 144.56 days, and 99.7% for 149.34 days. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher's Office.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Performance Analysis of Neo4j, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL on 2019 National Election Big Data Management Database","[{""Penulis"":""Wiseso, Linggis Galih""},{""Penulis"":""Imrona, Mahmud""},{""Penulis"":""Alamsyah, Andry""}]","Data has now become a major commodity and asset for any organization. There's also a phenomenon called Big Data where it's a term to describes a large volume of data, both structured and unstructured. With big data, any organization can analyze the data and its results are used for decision making and business strategy. Political parties, for example, use it to analyze the likelihood of their candidate winning in the election based on voter data who votes for their candidate. In Indonesia itself, the use of big data has not been utilized because of limited database infrastructure. Therefore, Indonesia needs a good database that can utilize big data. In this study, the author examines the performance of PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Neo4J by analyzing each of its complexity using computational complexity theory with Big O notation as its tool. With Big O, the author measures the complexity of each execution time. The conclusion from this study is that MongoDB has excellent performance because it has an O(1) complexity, PostgreSQL has good performance because it has an O(n) and O(1) complexities, and Neo4j has worse performance than MongoDB and PostgreSQL because it has an O(nlog n) complexity. © 2020 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Indonesian text classification using back propagation and sastrawi stemming analysis with information gain for selection feature,"[{""Penulis"":""Purbolaksono, Mahendra Dwifebri""},{""Penulis"":""Reskyadita, Feddy Dea""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""},{""Penulis"":""Suryani, Arie Ardiyanti""},{""Penulis"":""Huda, Arief Fatchul""}]","The second fundamental source of law for Moslems is the Hadith. The Hadith can be used to explain Quranic texts. However, Hadith still needs to be translated according to each national language to easily understand its meaning [1]. In Indonesia Hadith more usually refers to a special class of relevance to more particular religious concern [1]. Base on that, this research will Classify the translation Hadith Text into three classes: Obligation, Prohibition, and Information. From previous research, the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) showed good performance in classifying hadith text. Therefore, BPNN was used to solve the problem of hadith text classification in this study. However, the dataset has a huge number of varied bag-of-words, which are features that will be used in the classification process. Hence, Information Gain (IG) was utilized to select influential features, and as the sequential process before the classification process. To measure the performance of this system, the Macro F1-Score was used. The F1-Score enables one to observe exactness from precision and completeness from recall. The Macro F1-score is also needed for the performance evaluation of more than two classes. Based on the experiment conducted, the system was able to classify hadith text using BPNN, IG, and without stemming, yielding the highest F1-score of 84.63%. However, the system performance that included the stemming process yielded an F1-score of 80.92%. This shows that the stemming process could decrease classification performance. This decreasing performance is due to some influential words merging with more noninfluential words. © 2020 Insight Society.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
End-to-End Speech Recognition Models for a Low-Resourced Indonesian Language,"[{""Penulis"":""Suyanto, Suyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Arifianto, Anditya""},{""Penulis"":""Sirwan, Anis""},{""Penulis"":""Rizaendra, Angga P.""}]","Recent automatic speech recognition (ASR) is commonly developed using deep learning (DL), instead of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Many researchers show that DL is much better than HMM in noisy environments. However, DL needs a huge speech corpus but does not require any dictionary as well as the concept of either phonemes or syllables. Many DL-based tools are developed and claimed as a language-independent ASR, such as Mozma DeepSpeech (MDS) and Kaituoxu SpeechTransformer (KST). Both MDS and KST are classified as End-to-End ASR (E2EASR), but MDS uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) while KST exploits a Transformer Network. In this paper, two Indonesian ASR (INASR) are developed using both MDS and KST to see their performances to handle a low-resourced language.

"Thermal performance, parametric analysis, and multi-objective optimization of a direct-expansion solar-assisted heat pump water heater using NSGA-II and decision makings","[{""Penulis"":""Cao, Yan""},{""Penulis"":""Mihardjo, Leonardus W.W.""},{""Penulis"":""Parikhani, Towhid""}]","Direct-expansion solar-assisted heat pump water heaters (DX-SAHPWHs) are conducive to the environment due to the use of ambient energy and solar radiation. This paper aims to design and develop a thermodynamic model and a multi-criteria optimization of thermal performance for a DX-SAHPWH using R-134a as the working refrigerant that supplies domestic hot water for a typical building throughout the whole year. The thermodynamic model of the DX-SAHPWH is developed so that the performance of the system is solved through the try and error technique with the least initial data of the thermodynamic cycle of DX-SAHPWH. After the validation of the thermodynamic model, the performance of the DX-SAHPWH is analyzed for a typical building located at the temperate climate of Iran. Then, a parametric study is conducted to identify how various design parameters may affect the performance of the DX-SAHPWH system. In the current investigation, the effects of design parameters including solar radiation intensity, ambient air temperature, outlet water temperature of the condenser, solar collector area, compressor speed, length of tube in the condenser, external diameter of the tube in collector plate, fin thickness, and thermal conductivity of collector plate on the performance of the DX-SAHPWH are investigated. Besides, single and bi-criteria optimizations are carried out using genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the optimal solutions of design parameters, where the coefficient of performance (COP) and the solar collector efficiency (SCE) are selected as two fitness functions. The optimal solutions achieved from the bi-criteria optimization process will be given as Pareto frontier. The final optimum solution from the available solutions on the Pareto optimal frontier is selected using decision-making methods, such as LINMAP, TOPSIS, and Shannon's Entropy. The comparison of single and bi-criteria optimization results illustrate that the bi-criteria optimization method yields more proper results than single ones, mainly because of the lower deviation index from the ideal solution. The results of bi-criteria optimization show that SCE decreases 1.6% compared to the initial model while the COP increases close to 20% that makes the optimum solution more desirable compared to the single ones. Moreover, the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH system is compared with the initial model in each month of the year. The results indicate that the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH is highly improved so that the working hours of the system decrease close to 109 h compared to the initial model during the whole year. © 2020","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Implementation of Simulated Annealing-Support Vector Machine on QSAR Study of Fusidic Acid Derivatives as Anti-Malarial Agent,"[{""Penulis"":""Rahman, Farisi""},{""Penulis"":""Lhaksmana, Kemas Muslim""},{""Penulis"":""Kurniawan, Isman""}]","Malaria is a disease caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite and leads to many cases of deaths. Recently, the combination of several drugs has been used to treat this disease. However, the parasite is known to be resistant to the anti-malarial agent. Hence, a new candidate for an anti-malarial drug is required to solve the resistance problem. One compound that is promising as an anti-malarial agent is fusidic acid derivatives. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic that is work by preventing parasite growth. Besides, fusidic acid is known to have antiplasmodial activity although the IC50 is still poor. However, the activity can be improved by optimizing the structure through its derivatives. In this study, we developed a QSAR model to predict the activity of fusidic acid derivatives as anti-malarial agent. The model was developed by using Simulated Annealing (SA) for feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for model development. The results show that SA produces a satisfying combination of features that are indicated by the trend of MSE value during the selection process. Regarding the performance, SVM with RBF kernel produces the best result of the validation parameter. This indicates that the model is valid to be used to predict a compound with unknown activity values for anti-malarial agents.  © 2020 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Foot Plantar Pressure to Detect Obesity,"[{""Penulis"":""Nursida, Yulistia Elsa""},{""Penulis"":""Erfianto, Bayu""},{""Penulis"":""Rakhmatsyah, Andrian""}]","Physically we can see that there is a difference between obese and non-obese people, it's seen from a fatter body posture. Then we can categorize the person into obese or not by calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI). But this still must be done manually because we have to check weight and height first, then calculated BMI according to the BMI formula. Therefore we need a system that can be used to detect obesity automatically. In this study, we created a system that can detect obesity automatically based on foot plantar pressure. On foot plantar pressure there is a significant change between foot pressure in obese and non-obese people. In obese people the pressure will be further increased in the metatarsal foot, heel, and midfoot. This is because the heel is part of the foot which is the main support of the body and in the midfoot there are different levels of leg curvature between obese and non-obese people. The system is built using Fuzzy Inference System based on Fuzzy Logic Concept. So, the system can provide an automatic output whether the person is categorized as thin, normal, or obese.  © 2020 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Deciphering social opinion polarization towards political events based on content and structural analysis,"[{""Penulis"":""Alamsyah, Andry""},{""Penulis"":""Rochmah, Wachda Yuniar""},{""Penulis"":""Nurnafia, Arina Nahya""}]","There is evidence to suggest that social opinion polarization leads to the breakup of relationships, sometimes on a scale of small communities, but it can occasionally divide large organizations or even a nation. The methodology often used to investigate the root cause of opinion polarization in society is random sampling or a questionnairebased approach, which are considered expensive and time-consuming. On the contrary, a large-scale approach using social media can provide a rich source of data for the investigation of several questions, such as: how does social opinion polarization form, what changes occur in social network mechanisms, and who are the dominant actors and communities? The power of a big data approach lies in the volume of data analysed; the more data involved in the process, the more accurately it describes the population. Today, computing power is no longer an obstacle to the large-scale processing of data, and thus, the observation of social opinion polarization processes becomes possible. This research investigates the root cause of social opinion polarization by using a topic modelling methodology. The dynamic social network mechanism is measured using social network properties. Identification of influential actors and communities are provided by social network analysis metrics and methodologies. By answering the three major questions above, this study examines opinion polarization and its growth over time, both for their topology structure and conversational content. This knowledge gives insight into how and when opinion separation takes place.

Unfortunately, the widespread use of motorcycles in Indonesia coincides with a high number of motorcycle accidents which can often be attributed to unsafe behaviors of the motorcyclist. One unsafe behavior that is common and hypothetically associated with accidents is the use of a mobile phone while motorcycling. The aim of the present study was to observe the prevalence and behavior of mobile phone use among Indonesian motorcyclists and the factors that might have influenced their behavior. Methods: Five hundred Indonesian motorcyclists voluntarily participated in this study by filling out a questionnaire that gathered demographic data, motorcycling behaviors, and a statement related to what factors might influence their likelihood to use a mobile phone while motorcycling. A descriptive statistic and Structural Equation Modeling were applied in analyzing the data. Results: Results showed that the prevalence of mobile phone use among Indonesian motorcyclists was 75%. The demographic data that significantly influenced mobile phone use during motorcycling were age, education level, marital status, and number of children. Occupation, gender, and prior experiences that included accidents and tickets with fines did not influence the use of mobile phones during motorcycling. The behavioral model showed that the factors that influenced motorcyclist's intentions to avoid mobile phone use during motorcycling were attitude, perceived behavioral control, and cues to action. Conclusions: This study supports previous findings regarding the high prevalence of mobile phone use among motorcyclists in developing countries. The models implied that further investigation on intervention strategy to minimize mobile phone use during motorcycling is a necessity. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

We used a webcam to capture a shadow image of a 4cm bolt that placed on a flat plane. Then, the image from the shadow is processed to get the angle of the sun. We use trigonometric formulas to convert bolt shadows into angles. After that, the angle used as input for the solar panel drive motor. Thus, the solar panel can be adjusted to follow the angle of the sun. So that the positions are orthogonal to each other. The research finding discovered that the prototype can always follow the direction of incoming sunlight with an accuracy rate towards the center point is 95% for azimuth (X-axis) and 96% for altitude (Y-axis). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Forecasting for a data-driven policy using time series methods in handling COVID-19 pandemic in Jakarta,"[{""Penulis"":""Sulasikin, Andi""},{""Penulis"":""Nugraha, Yudhistira""},{""Penulis"":""Kanggrawan, Juan""},{""Penulis"":""Suherman, Alex L.""}]","The coronavirus diseases 2019 or COVID-19 has spread and infected millions of people around the world. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on residents, business, commerce, and activity in many cities, including Jakarta, where there have been more than twelve thousand confirmed cases as of July 2020. The details of how COVID-19 spreads in Jakarta are still complicated and not completely understood because the number of infections is large and continues to climb. This paper conducts a quantitative analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading using Jakarta as a case study for the evaluation and decision-making process. In this paper, time series models such as the Holt's exponential smoothing and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) were used to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta between March 1 and July 6. Recently, data exploration and comparative analysis of time series models have been conducted to determine the optimal models for forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases. The result shows that ARIMA has the highest R-Squared (R2), and lowest (Mean Squared Error) MSE and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the best model to forecast the upcoming number of infected cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta. Such a model shows promising results and fitting predictions in supporting data-driven policy in public health and epidemiology.  © 2020 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The conversion process of these organic materials takes several weeks in anaerobic conditions by using microbes to overhaul the organic material. In its implementation, biogas reactors are not equipped with appropriate measuring instruments, such as instruments to measure the volume of gas produced by the reactor, so the users do not know the volume of gas produced by the reactor. In this research, an Internet of Things (IoT) biogas production volume monitoring system will be developed. The biogas measurement data is sent to the IoT platform so that data about daily biogas production can be monitored directly form far away. The measurement process carried out by the flowmeter sensor will be received and processed by a microcontroller. The process of sending data to the IoT platform is done using the GSM/ GPRS communication module with a delivery time of every 15 minutes. GSM/ GPRS communication module can transmit data with an average time of 36.2 seconds. The accuracy of the flowmeter sensor used on standard measuring devices is 94,84% with an error of + 5.16%. Accuracy of volume accumulation by the microcontroller to the reference volume is 95,75%. with an error of + 4.25%.

The accurate prediction of water quality index is an essential requisite for water quality management, human health, public consumption, and domestic uses. A comprehensive review as an initial attempt is conducted on existing solutions through data-driven models. In addition, the ensemble Kalman filter is found to be a suitable data assimilation method, which is successfully applied in hydrological variables modeling and other complexes, nonlinear, and chaotic problems. In this study, a new application of ensemble Kalman filter-artificial neural network is proposed to predict water quality index using physicochemical parameters for two commonly pollutant rivers, namely Klang and Langat, in Malaysia. As a further attempt, in order to improve the models’ performance, a new preprocessing technique is adopted as the newly constructed assimilated model. The results confirm that ensemble hybrid based intrinsic time-scale decomposition has reduced root mean square error by 24% for Klang and 34% for Langat, respectively, compared with the intrinsic time-scale decomposition-conventional neural network model.

As a case study, we use the most popular Online Travel Agencies (OTA) providers in Indonesia: Traveloka, Tiket.com, and Pegipegi. Based on our criterion, we examine the fulfillment and responsiveness dimensions of these three OTA providers. We apply Naïve Bayes Classifier (NB) model to classify users' opinions. This model has accuracy around 75-85% for the three OTA providers. The result reveals that Pegipegi obtains better service quality with 57% positive and 43% negative sentiment than Traveloka and Tiket.com with 56% positive and 44% negative. The overall result shows general topics of fulfillment and responsiveness dimensions are related to the ticket availability and customer service performances.  © 2020 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Detection of level crossing barriers using the histogram of oriented gradients method and support vector machine,"[{""Penulis"":""Sugiana A.""},{""Penulis"":""Aprillia B.S.""},{""Penulis"":""Rifqi M.N.""}]","Railroad crossing is a place where the railroad lines intersect with other roads, such as a highway. Referring to the Regulation of Minister of Transportation No. 36/2011, level crossing must be equipped with signs, markers and traffic signaling devices and crossing gate guards. However, 4600 of the 5800 level crossing points are without railroad keeper so that they are prone to traffic accidents. In addition, hazard information (danger signs) from the railroad keeper to the PUSDALOP and machinists sometimes cannot be seen at night and in a foggy situation. Therefore, this research aims to detect obstacles (cars) at a railroad crossing using the Histogram of Oriented gradient (HOG) method and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. HOG functions to extract object features (cars), while SVM is responsible for classifying car objects whether they fit the criteria of car features or not. The results show that an accuracy rate of car objects was 85%, 73% for empty train tracks and 91% for detection of passing trains. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Energy balanced threshold using game theory algorithm for wireless sensor networks optimization,"[{""Penulis"":""Hendrarini, Nina""},{""Penulis"":""Asvial, Muhamad""},{""Penulis"":""Sari, Riri Fitri""}]","The wireless sensor network (WSN) as a supporting monitoring system requires stable conditions. The clustering mechanism in wireless sensor networks has been implemented to reduce energy waste. Therefore, maintaining energy in a balanced cluster head is very important. Logically, the distance between the cluster member nodes and the cluster head, and the distance of the head to sink node can affect the stability of the network while it is related to energy resources. To maintain a balanced environment, head cluster energy configuration management is a priority. One effective way to extend network life is to maintain energy balance. The main objective of this paper is to optimize the sensor network by modifying the Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC) protocol using the Game Theory algorithm. Here, game theory has been introduced into the solution of problems by finding threshold values. Nash Equilibrium, a concept of game theory is used to have a correlation between energy variables, and non-cooperative behaviour as a character of game theory. In this work, DEEC protocol- A heterogeneous cluster protocol-has been modified in terms of threshold factors to improve the performance of wireless sensor networks. The threshold will filter out nodes that are not suitable to be cluster heads, so the wrong cluster head selection will not occur. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

As a subject with potential and, at the same time, objects in their activities and creativity, students are expected to be able to develop their qualities. The quality can be seen from the academic achievements achieved, which are evidence of the effort earned by students. Student academic achievement is evaluated at the end of each semester to determine the learning outcomes that have been achieved. If a student cannot meet certain academic criteria to be declared eligible to continue their studies, the student is declared to be not graduating on time or even dropout (DO). The high number of students not graduating on time or dropouts at higher institutions can be minimized by the policies of higher institutions by directing and detecting at-risk students in the early stages of education. Therefore, in this paper, we present the use of Fuzzy Soft Set Classification (FSSC), which is based on the Fuzzy Soft set theory to predict student graduation. The 2068 dataset was taken from the Directorate of Information Systems, Ahmad Dahlan University. The results showed that the FSSC reached up to 0.893292 in terms of accuracy.

However, studies on molecular interactions between PC with α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes are still rare. In this study, an in-silico study was carried out to predict the molecular interactions between PC with α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. Molecular docking simulations indicated that PC inhibits the enzymes by binding to the active site and causing a disruption on substrate-enzyme binding. In both enzymes, PC seem to play a crucial role in establishing the interaction within the cavity of active sites. This result suggested PC as a potential candidate for antidiabetic natural therapeutic agents. An in-vitro inhibition activity test showed that PC inhibits human salivary amylase at average of 51.13 %. A storage stability tests showed that keeping PC in solid-state, absence of lights and low temperature can preserve the bioactivity when used as functional compounds. Taken together, this current result would be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between PC and carbohydrate-metabolisms enzymes and contribute to making full use of PC as antidiabetic drug or therapeutic agent.

Technical specification for effective next generation network interconnection in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Abdurohman, Maman""},{""Penulis"":""Nugroho, Bambang Setia""}]","This paper proposes technical specifications for effectively implementing the interconnection of Next Generation Network (NGN) in Indonesia. NGN is one of the current telecommunication infrastructure network technology trends. It provides a simpler concept with only two layers of service and transport. The NGN IP-based transport system can connect with various types of networks, which leads to low management costs by offering different kinds of services. Meanwhile, there are currently various types of telecommunication networks depending on the services provided, such as Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), IPv4 Internet as well as Public Switched Data Network (PSDN). PSTN is a circuit-switched voice communications network, and PSDN is a network for data-based communications with International Telecommunication Union (ITU)-T X.121 standards. Another type is a packet-switched based network that uses IPv4 addressing systems. Each network has its customers. One of the problems that arise, however, is how to transform the current network system to the NGN network effectively. The effectiveness of network transformation in the service provision for users is determined by the technical aspects used. Some of the technical aspects issues on implementation of NGN networks in Indonesia are the use of a protocol for signaling, coding standards, Quality of Service (QoS), numbering and addressing, and security. This paper proposes technical specifications for the effectiveness of NGN network implementation in Indonesia. Through the technical specification model, we propose, the risks that will arise in the implementation of NGN networks in Indonesia can be managed. Appropriate technical specifications have an essential role in the effectiveness of NGN network implementation in Indonesia. © 2020, Insight Society.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

As most of the human's life is spent indoor, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) - an air quality inside of a building represented by pollutant concentration and thermal condition - is one factor that needs to be concerned to sustain healthy living. In this research, we developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based IAQ monitoring device using low-cost sensors that measure the concentrations of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Oxygen (O2), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5). This device connects to an Android application to further observe these parameters inside two practicum laboratories in Telkom University, Bandung, for a total duration of six weeks. The location is surrounded by urban air pollution, particularly industrial activities, and residential waste burning. We also have sites of outdoor air quality monitoring system for simultaneous measurement. The environmental conditions were observed under no human activities, human intervention, and indoor plants' influence (i.e., Dieffenbachia sp.). Results show that pollutant concentrations are considerably influenced by outdoor conditions, occupancy level, and ventilation rate. Indoor plants can reduce CO2 concentrations inside the room (21-47%). On the other hand, there is no clear evidence that PM2.5 mass concentrations were affected by human activities. The bigger particles (PM >2.5 microns) probably were the ones induced by occupants during practicum. Therefore, using low-cost sensors is trustworthy to monitor IAQ for a better quality of life. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

In this research, 100WP Monocrystalline solar panel power output will be enhanced by using cooling system to reduce the temperature of the solar panel. Cooling system of the solar panel is applied by flowing the water on the surface of the solar panel using 12V DC water pump. The experiment starts from 11:00 AM to 01:00 PM. The result of this experiment is the power output of the solar panel increased up to 5.79 Watt with the average about 2.96 Watt and the temperature of the solar panel decreased by 20.99°C. The temperature of the solar panel without cooling is about 52.83°C and with the cooling system is about 31.85°C. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The Statistic Indonesia (BPS) uses a method with basic needs or can be called the needs for basic needs to measure the level of welfare in an area. This concept uses the human basic needs of food and non-food to measure poverty levels in the region through a national socioeconomic survey (SUSENAS). SUSENAS is expected to spend a large amount of time and financial resources because in these activities interviews are being conducted for each household using a questionnaire. Nowadays, doing questionnaires, interviews and surveys are no longer the only way to collect data. One can also obtain data from an e-commerce dataset. In 2018, a trade union association of management consultants McKinsey and Company published the results of their research in the form of the current status of the Indonesian e-commerce market in the future. The results of the research show the growth in value and the impact of growth on the socio-economic aspect of the Indonesian ecommerce market today until 2022.

This device is critical to ensure power quality and reliable electricity supply for consumers. When the power transformer could not work properly or out of service in unforeseen ways, it provides a severe impact on power system utilities and customers in term of the expensive of transformer's replacement cost and revenue lost caused by the electrical blackout. To overcome these issues, the proper prognostics health management (PHM) system as a tool for condition monitoring and health assessment of these valuable assets is required. This paper proposed a PHM system based on a kernel extreme learning machine (K-ELM) for power transformer's health assessment. Two sets of variable combinations called Set-1 and Set-2 were considered to examine the robustness and efficacy of the proposed method. In Set-1, the input variables were water content, total acidity, breakdown voltage, dissipation factor, dissolved combustible gases, and 2-furfuraldehyde. While the output of PHM system was the health condition which categorized as good, moderate, and bad circumstances. Set-2 utilized water content, total acidity, breakdown voltage, dissipation factor, and interfacial tension as input variables. Whereas, the PHM system outputs consisted of four categories: normal, good, moderate, and bad. The proposed method with two sets of variables had showed the satisfactory results for transformer's health condition assessment compared to an extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) in terms of learning and testing accuracies and computation time. The proposed PHM system using the Set-1 dataset could assess the transformer health as of 100% while in terms of the testing process, the proposed PHM system has an excellent accuracy result as of 68.67%. Furthermore, the proposed PHM system using the Set-2 dataset had successfully assessed the transformer health as of 100%. In the testing phase, the proposed PHM system model has a rigorous result for its accuracy result as of 93.61%. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Decision Tree Regression with AdaBoost Ensemble Learning for Water Temperature Forecasting in Aquaponic Ecosystem,"[{""Penulis"":""Taufiqurrahman, Akbar""},{""Penulis"":""Putrada, Aji Gautama""},{""Penulis"":""Dawani, Febri""}]","In an aquaponic system, fish as a producer of nutrients for plants must be healthy at all times. One of the important aspects affecting fish health is water temperature. Therefore, a lot of research have tried to make a control system that can stabilize the water temperature according to the conditions needed by the fish. In certain climatic conditions, extreme water temperature changes will endanger the fish health, and many control systems from the research that have been done are not responsive to extreme water temperature changes. Decision Tree Regression (DTR) forecasting can optimize temperature control, but overfitting can be occurred. The purpose of this paper is to maximize the function of the water temperature control system by implementing the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. AdaBoost algorithm can reduce overfitting in the DTR model during the learning process. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, an IoT-based aquaculture system was built. Based on the implementation of the water temperature control system that has been done, it can be concluded that the DTR model using the AdaBoost algorithm has better performance with a mean squared error (MSE) value of 0.00454 and an R-Squared value of 0.92847, compared to a DTR model without the AdaBoost algorithm with an MSE value of 0.01211 and an R-Squared value of 0.80920, at the same max depth that is 8.  © 2020 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

Gene mutation detection for breast cancer disease: A review,"[{""Penulis"":""Wisesty U.N.""},{""Penulis"":""Mengko T.R.""},{""Penulis"":""Purwarianti A.""}]","Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases suffered, especially by women, in the world, and about two billion new cases of patients with breast cancer in 2018. Therefore, it is very important to detect cancer early. Early detection of cancer can be done through the analysis of DNA abnormalities from blood cell samples, where the sampling does not require surgery, non-invasive and painless, and can reduce the sampling cost. DNA abnormalities can occur due to heredity or gene mutation. This paper presents a systematic review that includes an explanation of DNA sequences, gene mutations that occur in breast cancer, and bioinformatics techniques for detecting breast cancer. From several studies that have been conducted in the medical field there are mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 genes, where mutations in these genes can cause an increased risk of breast cancer. Other gene mutations associated with cancer risk are ATM, BARD1, CDH1, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, TP53, PTEN, RAD50, RECQL, RINT1. In bioinformatics, breast cancer detection based on DNA sequence data is carried out in three phases namely data mapping, feature extraction, and prediction / classification. The methods that can be used are Voss mapping and its variations for data mapping, statistical feature representation approach and Wavelet analysis for feature extraction, and regression approaches, probability models, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks and Deep Learning for classification. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
A technical and economic analysis of solar PV with local tariff policy in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Adam K.B.""},{""Penulis"":""Ramdhani M.""},{""Penulis"":""Suhartono E.""}]","Indonesia is still struggling to attract investors in developing the solar photovoltaic (PV) project. The government issued the first regulation on solar PV, announced in 2016. A revision on the local tariff regulation is conducted to reduce the rapid development of the solar PV investment. The major revision is made to change the contract scheme from a build-operate-own (BOO) to a build-operate-own-transfer (BOOT) scheme. This paper investigates how the new local tariff will drive investors and developers to invest in solar PV. This analysis is conducted to know the effectiveness of the policy and the risk of PV investment in Indonesia. Local tariff policy regulation targets PV developers to invest in the solar PV system areas. In the local tariff policy, each area has its PV energy tariff determined by the government. This research proposes a method for deciding demand by considering population data in selected regions to calculate the maximum PV demand of each area. The Levelized Cost of Energy LCOE is used to calculate the economic viability of the PV projects in selected areas in Indonesia. The results show that more than half of the selected areas are profitable for the PV project. The average profit of the projects of the selected areas is 3.21 cent USD per kWh. Most of the areas that have high PV demand have lower local tariffs. Therefore, these areas may not be profitable for developers. The new regulation also cuts the revenue significantly due to the new scheme contract. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Energy Consumption Performance on IEEE 802.11ah Networks with Station Grouping Scheme,"[{""Penulis"":""Aminah A.S.""},{""Penulis"":""Perdana D.""},{""Penulis"":""Wahidah I.""}]","Sending packages from the sender to the recipient at the station requires adequate resources. To ensure messages in the form of text, data, images, and videos are received in real-time, reliably, and flexibly, power performance with low energy consumption is required at the station. IEEE 802.11ah can be one of the wireless technologies to overcome this problem by saving low power consumption, the transmission range of 1 km and access points can reach 8191 stations. The purpose of this study was to determine the performance of energy-saving consumption by station grouping which is regulated in the regulation of the number of RAW slots. From the results of this study, energy savings were obtained by dividing the two groups when the station numbered 900 stations with an energy consumption of 8.105 joules while in one group with a smaller station scale the total energy consumption of 8.124 joules was obtained. The second scheme is by dividing slots (NRawSlot) to reduce energy consumption in large station capacities. The NRawSlot division is divided into seven-slot with energy consumption of 8,105 joules. It is proven that energy consumption is more efficient by grouping with more station capacity.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

For Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), it is required to precisely recognize and locate scenes in sensor data. Semantic segmentation is one of computer vision methods intended to perform such tasks. However, the existing semantic segmentation tasks label each pixel with a single object’s class. Recognizing object attributes, e.g., pedestrian orientation, will be more informative and help for a better scene understanding. Thus, we propose a method to perform semantic segmentation with pedestrian attribute recognition simultaneously. We introduce an attribute-aware loss function that can be applied to an arbitrary base model. Furthermore, a re-annotation to the existing Cityscapes dataset enriches the ground-truth labels by annotating the attributes of pedestrian orientation. We implement the proposed method and compare the experimental results with others. The attribute-aware semantic segmentation shows the ability to outperform baseline methods both in the traditional object segmentation task and the expanded attribute detection task.

"Removing Noise, Reducing dimension, and Weighting Distance to Enhance k-Nearest Neighbors for Diabetes Classification","[{""Penulis"":""Khairunnisa, Syifa""},{""Penulis"":""Suyanto, Suyanto""},{""Penulis"":""Eko Yunanto, Prasti""}]","Various methods of machine learning have been implemented in the medical field to classify various diseases, such as diabetes. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the most known approaches for predicting diabetes. Many researchers have found by combining KNN with one or more other algorithms may provide a better result. In this paper, a combination of three procedures, removing noise, reducing the dimension, and weighting distance, is proposed to improve a standard voting-based KNN to classify Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) into two classes. First, the noises in the training set are removed using k-means clustering (KMC) to make the voter data in both classes more competent. Second, its dimensional is then reduced to decrease the intra-class data distances but increase the inter-class ones. Two methods of dimensional reduction: principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoder (AE), are applied to investigate the linearity of the dataset. Since there is an imbalance on the dataset, a proportional weight is incorporated into the distance formula to get the fairness of the voting. A 5-fold cross validation-based evaluation shows that each proposed procedure works very well in enhancing the KNN. KMC is capable of increasing the accuracy of KNN from 81.6% to 86.7%. Combining KMC and PCA improves the KNN accuracy to be 90.9%. Next, a combination of KMC and AE enhances the KNN to gives an accuracy of 97.8%. Combining three proposed procedures of KMC, PCA, and Weighted KNN (WKNN) increases the accuracy to be 94.5%. Finally, the combination of KMC, AE, and WKNN reaches the highest accuracy of 98.3%. The facts that AE produces higher accuracies than PCA inform that the features in the dataset have a high non-linearity.  © 2020 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

In recent years, sustainability has become a major concern and challenge for manufacturing systems because of growing consciousness of the effects of their activities on the environment, society, and economy. Different organizational reports and the academic literature have proposed indicators of sustainable manufacturing that help to measure product and process sustainability. However, little of the previous research is related to employee-activity based indicators for production process sustainability. To bridge the gap, this study identified a set of indicators of production process sustainability based on direct and indirect impacts of manufacturing activities on employees, who are key resources in the entire production process, for efficiently applying a sustainability perspective. In addition, the paper provides an evaluation model for selecting relatively important indicators based on expert opinions. A fuzzy Delphi method was applied for the screening process of the decision makers (experts). A Delphi questionnaire prepared with a nine-point linguistic scale corresponding to respective linguistic variables was utilized to assess expert opinions on the importance of each indicator. These expert opinions were aggregated for each indicator by using an adopted algorithm that considers the degree of importance allocated to the decision makers, and the similarity and distance among decision maker opinions.

To measure the performance of those plants, gross electricity generation was considered as output for the stochastic frontier model, whereas fuel consumption, lube oil consumption, auxiliary consumption, cost, heat rate, and hours of run were considered as input variables. Based on the log-likelihood hypothesis test, trans-log production model is preferred over Cobb-Douglas (C-D) production model for this study. The average efficiency of the selected plants is above 90 percent, and there is Sylhet Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) which has an efficiency of about 78.6 percent for truncated normal distribution. In the time-variant inefficiency effects model, fuel consumption, cost, square product of lube oil consumption, interaction between fuel consumption and lube oil consumption as well as auxiliary consumption, and hours of run have a significant positive influence on power generation.

Supported by a transportation system that is certainly sophisticated. The two systems are part of smart city that are applied in big cities. Basically, all communicate with each other to create an integrated smart city. However, the communication must be in real time domain so that all smart city components are connected. In this research case a vehicle counting system in real-time that can calculate vehicles passing on a road segment is designed. Applications used are ultrasound sensors, microcontrollers, and an Internet of Things Platform that are interconnected to monitor road conditions. Normalized Cross-Correlation algorithm is used to detect passing vehicles. The concept that Normalized Cross-Correlation algorithm is an algorithm to determine the similarity in two frequency signals is used to detect ultrasound frequencies created by cars passing by the sensor. The system will detect by comparing input data from ultrasound sensors by making sample data first then the sample data is compared with the data after the sample data. After that the correlation value will come out which has been normalized on a scale of 0-1.0. From applying normalized cross-correlation method the threshold for the calculation of the vehicle is determined, which is ¡0.70. This threshold is determined as the optimum value after various tests. After testing the method in real environment the error rate of the method in counting passing vehicles is 10.1%.  © 2020 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

One of the new PON technologies used by telecommunication operators in Indonesia is the 10-Gigabit-capable symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON). However, there is no technical standardization related to multicast services on the XGS-PON system. Therefore, this study will develop a test method and evaluate multicast services' performance on Optical Line Termination (OLT) equipment of XGS-PON. The OLT has the most critical function in managing services, including distributing Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service to customers. Six parameters proposed as standardization regulation to determine the XGS-PON OLT capability are as follows: IGMP version 2, IGMP version 3, IGMP Proxy, IGMP transparent snooping, IGMP snooping with proxy reporting, and IGMP Multicast Group. The experiment result confirmed that XGS-PON OLT supports multicast protocols following ITU-T G.9807.1 recommendations, namely IGMP version 2 and IGMP version 3. It also shows that XGS-PON OLT supports IGMP mode capabilities such as IGMP proxy mode, IGMP transparent snooping mode, and IGMP snooping with proxy reporting. Furthermore, XGS-PON OLT supports the maximum number of multicast groups simultaneously for 2048 IGMP multicast groups following the TR-101 guideline from Broadband Forum.

Due to this, the production of cement has become very crucial, resulting in a high carbon footprint and pollution along the process. Therefore, the utilization of agricultural by-products as cement replacement will help to reduce pollution caused by conventional cement production and therefore reduce the unsystematic waste management. Rice husk ash contains high silica content that makes it a potential material to partially replace cement in concrete production. This is because, the reaction between rice husk ash and cement can improve the compressive strength of the concrete. With the aid of response surface methodology, the optimization of utilizing rice husk ash as a partial replacement of cement in concrete can be achieved.

The effect plates of the MED normally use a flat metal plate attached to a fabric wick on its one surface to secure the evaporation area and time. However, the process attaching the wick to the plate causes an increase in manufacturing time and cost, and detachment of the aged wick from the plate causes a decrease in the still’s performance and reliability. To solve these problems, we have developed a wick-free plate without wick, which can replace the wick-plate. We selected seven characteristics required for the wick-free plate and fabricated wick-free plate specimens such as etching plate, 3D printing plate, and porous metal plate. Then, their performances were compared with the wick-plate by analyzing the characteristics. Experimental results showed that the etching plate of grooved shape is appropriate for wick-free plate and the optimum patterned shape of the grooved plate is 3.5 mm for the pitch, 3.0 mm for the furrow, and 2.0 mm for the depth.

Statistical analysis to determine the ground truth of fatigue driving state using ECG Recording and subjective reporting,"[{""Penulis"":""Halomoan, Junartho""},{""Penulis"":""Ramli, Kalamullah""},{""Penulis"":""Sudiana, Dodi""}]","In 2018, the World Health Organization reported about 1.35 million deaths caused by traffic accidents, which are also the leading cause of death of children and adolescents globally. Therefore, an early-warning system is needed to prevent accidents caused by fatigue driving. Research on driving-fatigue detection has determined the ground truth of the fatigue state by designing tests for specific conditions, designing tests at particular times, and relying on subjective reporting. Because determining the ground truth of the fatigue state affects the results of fatigue detection, this paper advances this investigation of the ground truth of the fatigue driving state and driving times using electrocardiogram recordings and a questionnaire that subjectively captures drivers' fatigue states. After five test sessions and heart-rate statistical data analysis, the minimum time required to induce a fatigue driving state in a driving simulation was 90 minutes with a Chalder Fatigue Scale score of 16. The driving-simulation software also affected the drivers' heart rates, however, so better programmable driving-simulation software is needed to create specific conditions, such as traffic density and limited driving speed, to induce realistic fatigue driving states.  © 2020 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Numerical Simulation of Tsunami Evacuation Route Planning in Padang Using Linear Programming,"[{""Penulis"":""Prayogo, Rizal Dwi""},{""Penulis"":""Karimah, Siti Amatullah""}]","This paper proposes an implementation of linear programming in tsunami horizontal evacuation routes decision making. A tsunami is a huge wave that travels with high speed towards a coastal area. Padang is the capital city of West Sumatera Province that is located in the coastal area as well as have a history of the tsunami disaster. The main problem is only a few minutes of the interval for the tsunami waves arrive at the coast after tsunami hazard warning. In the evacuation concept, the evacuees from the high-risk zone are moving to the shelter through a safe evacuation route. This research aims to determine the optimal evacuation routes with the constraints of a few minutes of the interval of evacuation time, the capacity of each shelter, and the number of evacuees. The evacuation time is an objective function that depends on the number of population, people density, road width, distance from the high-risk zone to the shelter, and velocity. The numerical simulation is done using linear programming with Matlab. The results show that all evacuees in each high-risk region are proportionally evacuated to available shelter areas within allocated evacuation time. The results of this research can be used for supporting tsunami evacuation plans and disaster resilience management by the authorities in Padang.  © 2020 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

This problem becomes complicated for universities with a large number of students and lecturers. Moreover, several universities are implementing student sectioning, which is a problem of assigning students to classes of a subject while respecting individual student requests, along with additional constraints. Such implementation also implies the complexity of constraints, which is larger accordingly. However, current and generic solvers have failed to meet the scalability and reliability requirements for student sectioning UCTP. In this paper, we introduce the localized island model genetic algorithm with dual dynamic migration policy (DM-LIMGA) to solve student sectioning UCTP.

With the growth of connected things, the most-widely used centralized (cloud-based) IDS often suffers from high latency and network overhead, thereby resulting in unresponsiveness to attacks and slow detection of malicious users. In this paper, we address the limitation of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices by proposing two methods, namely semi-distributed and distributed, that combine well-performing feature extraction and selection and exploit potential fog-edge coordinated analytics. In order to distribute the computational tasks, we individually develop parallel machine-learning models corresponding to a partitioned attack dataset. In the semi-distributed case, the parallel models, running on the edge side, are applied for side-by-side feature selections, which are then followed by a single multi-layer perceptron classification running on the fog side. In the distributed case, the parallel models individually perform both the feature selection and multi-layer perceptron classification after which the outputs are combined by a coordinating edge or fog for final decision making. Based on the comparative study of existing works, the numerical results demonstrate the promise of the proposed methods, giving a comparable detection accuracy to the superior centralized IDS as well as exemplify their inherent trade-offs between the accuracy and building time performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
The technical efficiency of transplanted aman rice farms in bangladesh,"[{""Penulis"":""Ferdushi, Kanis Fatama""},{""Penulis"":""Kamil, Anton Abdulbasah""}]","The comparison of technical efficiency scores has been estimated by the parametric and nonparametric production model for agricultural rice farms. This paper used a trans-log stochastic frontier model to explain the existing sources of inefficiency of rice farm due to socioeconomic and farm-specific variables in seven selected regions of Bangladesh based on agro-economic zone. The motivational point is to “start trade” in international rice market like other Asian countries. The results show that the estimated technical efficiency of Transplanted AMAN rice farms are vary from 45% to 92% in case of stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). In addition, the estimated technical efficiency is varying from 64% to 79% in case of data envelopment analysis (DEA). The farms’ distributed technical efficiency scores were found higher in the method of parametric SFA than nonparametric DEA in the regions of Dhaka, Khulna, Barisal and Rangpur. The graphical representation of the kernel density estimate indicates that inefficiency was among the farms in the all the selected regions. The results of kernel density estimate indicate that efficiency were negatively skewed in Dhaka, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal, Sylhet and Rangpur region. We can conclude that in some places, it can be possible to improve rice production using farmers existing input level. However, there is lot to subsidize for farmers which can be contributed by the local government. They should provide necessary supports for production for marginal farm owners such as training, credit, improved seed and fertilizers and also market facility. © The Author(s) 2020.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Constructing the ideal SRI (sustainability reporting index) framework for Indonesian market: combined perspectives from rating agencies, academics, and practitioners","[{""Penulis"":""Firmialy, Sita deliyana""},{""Penulis"":""Nainggolan, Yunieta Anny""}]","Purpose: This study aims to focus on developing the sustainability reporting index (SRI) with combined perspectives from varied social rating agencies, along with integrated combined perspectives from academics experts and Indonesian companies. Design/methodology/approach: The first section discusses the theoretical framework along with the sustainability challenges faced by companies in Indonesia. The second section develops the methodology of the study to measure the SRI by considering practical and theoretical perspectives, starting from the identification of initial disclosure, selecting the final disclosure and developing the hierarchical framework. Lastly, the third section confirms the validity of the study’s framework by the exploratory factor analysis method and its comparability by comparing the content analysis result of the study with the Kinder–Lydenberg–Domini (KLD) method. The content analysis was used to analyze annual reports, sustainability reports and companies’ websites based on indicators found in the resulted model. Findings: The main finding is the SRI framework (SRIF) of the study, which is built on the basis of the stakeholder relationship theory and is focused on three main dimensions (social, economic and environmental). Specifically, the framework consists of 17 indicators and 93 sub-indicators. On the basis of factor analysis method, it can be safely said that the study’s SRIF is quite valid. The high score of correlations between the SRIF and KLD results at the composite and dimension levels, along with the statistically significant results show that the study’s SRIF results and KLD results are fairly similar. Research limitations/implications: The present study has its limitation as it only gathers data from publicly available reports issued by the firms (secondary data). Owing to time limitation, primary data are not collected. However, this is also the strength of this research as it will allow investors to replicate the study’s methodology to measure companies’ sustainability. Practical implications: The study is useful to organizations and statutory bodies toward finding a replicable method to measure the Indonesian companies’ social performance. In addition, the study also introduced the usefulness of the qualitative program Atlas TI to perform content analysis, the exploratory factor analysis method to ensure validity and comparability by comparing it to the KLD methodology, which is known globally as the most widely accepted methodology to measures social performance. Lastly, this study will provide implications to the Government to ascertain the level of SRI reporting among the Indonesian public-listed companies. Originality/value: The resulted framework in this study simultaneously considers social, environmental and economic factors in the context of companies in Indonesia, while previous researchers have constructed reporting index separately (i.e. Sumiani et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2012). Especially in the context of Indonesia, there is no such index simultaneously focused on the three main dimensions, namely, social, environmental and economics. The current study tries to fill the gap by using the constructed SRI index based on three perspectives combined, namely, social rating agencies, academic theorist and Indonesian companies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Unfortunately, a large gap among PGE services occurred. Compared with ride-hailing services with highly frequent transactions, cleaning and mechanical services have had few transactions. This study aims to identify and analyze the factors that influence clients to use PGE services. Previous studies about users' intention were synthesized to develop the research model and hypothesis. Factors that are thought to have an influence on client behavior and intention are platform quality, trust, social influence, perceived risk, hedonic motivation, and economic benefits. Furthermore, a quantitative approach with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and 318 valid respondents is demonstrated. The results show that hedonic motivation is the most influencing factor followed by economic benefits, trust, and perceived platform quality. This study also informs that social influence only affects client on the early usage of PGE.

The network of patent citation data is analysed based on the key network measure (i.e., number of nodes, density, in-degree centrality, and out-degree centrality) and followed by developing the network trajectory. The main path analysis is obtained by using both SPLC method (Search Path Link Count) and the SPNP method (Search Path Nodes Pair). The main path further is analyzed along with its sub-path to understand the evolution of c-Si PV technology. The results indicate that: 1) the c-Si Solar cells technology has very low network density which means the patents are sparsely connected with each other, 2) The connected patents are the representative of the 'new' thin-film solar technology, 3) The most cited patent is not a part the main trajectory, meaning that there is a low correlation between patent and technology development, 4) The US, Japan, and Germany are the main actors in c-Si solar cells technology.

A test about communication range is performed with four nodes and one gateway with LoRa transceiver paired with Arduino boards, as LPWAN communication method, to be able to exchange information in terms of hardware and implement network mesh topologies to widen monitoring points in terms of software. It is shown from the test result that the communication range for the transmission between node to node or node to gateway reaches a maximum of 500 m close on the surface of the water. © 2019 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The Haematological profiles of high fat diet mice model with moringa oleifera leaves ethanol extract treatment,"[{""Penulis"":""Alia, Fenty""},{""Penulis"":""Syamsunarno, Mas Rizky A.A.""},{""Penulis"":""Sumirat, Vanessa Ayu""},{""Penulis"":""Ghozali, Mohammad""},{""Penulis"":""Atik, Nur""}]","Characteristics of obesity as dysfunction of adipose tissue and chronic low-grade inflammation can have impacts to haematological parameters. The Moringa oleifera leaves have been used empirically to treat metabolic and blood related diseases. However, it is still unknown whether Moringa oleifera leaves can influence haematological parameters in high fat diet. The study aimed to investigate the haematological parameter of high fat diet mice in parallel with Moringa oleifera leaves ethanol extract (MOLE). Forty male DDY mice in 5 weeks of age were randomly divided into five groups as follows: The SD group was fed with a standard diet, the HFD group was fed with high fat diet, the HFD+S group was fed with high fat diet and simvastatin (0,8 mg/20gBW/day). The HFD+MOLE1 and the HFD+MOLE2 groups were fed with high fat diet and MOLE in a dose of 5,6 mg/20gBW/day and 11,2 mg/20gBW/day, respectively. The experiment was performed for 7 weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood was drawn for haematology analysis of blood parameters. We found that sub-chronic high fat diet might alter the haematological parameters. Two different doses of MOLE might have potencies to prevent the worsening caused by those alterations, by increased of haemoglobin[12,9(10,4-15,3) vs 13,9(12,9-18,2) and 14(10,2-14,8), p>0,05)], slight decreased of WBC [(3,59±1,974) vs (3,433±1,747) and (3,42±1,014), p>0,05]. Additionally, the MOLE might have an effect to decreasing the granulocyte percentage [18,5(9,2-43,6) vs 11,5(7,6-18,2) and 8,05(3,2-25,1), p>0,05], and slight decreased of MPV [4,2(2,6-6,7) vs 3,6(3,2-4,1) and 3,55(2,6-6,8), p>0,05].

The Northeast Java Basin has various interesting phenomena, such as many oil fields, active faults, mud eruptions, and some active and dormant volcanoes. We measured temperature data from tens of wells along a 130 km survey line with an average spacing of 5 km. We also measured the thermal conductivity of rocks of various lithologies along the survey line to provide geothermal heat flow data. We propose integrated modeling for profiling the subsurface temperature beneath the survey line from Mt. Lawu to Mt. Muriah in the Northeast Java Basin. The modeling of subsurface temperature integrates various input data such as a thermal conductivity model, surface temperature, gradient temperature, a geological model, and geothermal heat flow. The thermal conductivity model considers the subsurface geological model. The temperature modeling uses the finite difference of Fourier's law, with an input subsurface thermal conductivity model, geothermal heat flow, and surface temperature.

Study of External Force and Impedance Scheme on Stroke Rehabilitation Robot Manipulator,"[{""Penulis"":""Sumarso, Ade Hasan""},{""Penulis"":""Widyotriatmo, Augie""},{""Penulis"":""Purnama, Irwan""}]","This paper presents rehabilitation robot with torque control with impedance scheme for post-stroke patients in the upper limb of the shoulder. This impedance scheme consists of external force input and impedance value. The external force input comes from the load cell at the end of the robot (the end effector), which is generated by the patient's force. The input force consists of two Cartesian directions, which will affect the robot dynamic torque for the X-axis and Y-axis. Meanwhile, the value of the impedance in the robotic system is provided by the therapist who handles the stroke patients. The amount of impedance in the robotic system can be adjusted according to the patient's condition. In this paper, we used 3 DOF (Degree of Freedom) self-produced robots. The rehabilitation trajectory consists of two parameters, the position parameter, and the torque control parameter in the impedance system. The impedance scheme in the robotic system use impedance characteristics and Proportional Integral (PI) controller. Proportional Integral (PI) controller is used as a simulation control in tracking errors of position and the torque impedance of the robot. With a simple controller, the characteristics relationship between the changes in the magnitude of the external force produced by the patient and the change in impedance values given to the robot system are obtained. By knowing these characteristics, robots can interact with various types of stroke patients. © 2019 IEEE.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The dynamics of the national economy is due to significant fluctuations in chili prices in Indonesia at all times. Price fluctuations occur due to lack of information either in the form of demand information or Chilean price information about consumers received by farmers for marketing red pepper. Besides, the length of the distribution of red pepper (farmer- the middleman- wholesaler- retailer- consumer) results in significant price changes from farmers to consumers at each echelon or distribution level. Such price changes result in a decline in the farmer's share. Farmer's share has a negative relationship with marketing margins. the negative relationship is the higher the marketing margin, the lower the share received by the farmer. from the explanation, the concept shows that the victims of the length of the distribution channel are farmers and consumers. Where farmers will bear a high business risk, and consumers will get high chili prices. The research will discuss how to stabilize the price of red pepper and improve farmer's share by making the best decision using discrete simulation using Monte Carlo, so it can determine the supply policy by the distribution at each level aimed at reducing the operational cost. Besides, this can also reduce the hoarding activities undertaken by the relevant distribution. The hoarding can disrupt the stability of the existing chili price. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Analysis of the influence of Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance as dimensionality reduction method on cancer classification based on microarray data using Support Vector Machine classifier,"[{""Penulis"":""Ma'Ruf, Firda Aminy""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""},{""Penulis"":""Wisesty, Untari Novia""}]","Microarray technology provides a way to monitor thousands of gene expressions at the same time. However, microarray data has a high dimensionality. This high dimensionality will affect the classification performance. In order to solve this issue, this research proposed the use of Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) as the dimension reduction method and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was also used as a comparison to MRMR. Tests on lung cancer and ovarian cancer data with MRMR and SVM linear kernel classifier as well as polynomial kernel resulted in an F1-score of 1, with the number of features used for the classification was 20% of the original feature dataset. This means that the accuracy of the classification was 100% and the system built has an excellent performance. As for the colon cancer classification, the F1-score result using MRMR and SVM polynomial kernel classifier was greater than the classification without the dimension reduction method, which is 0.84. It is the same with the classification of leukemia cancer, where the MRMR and SVM polynomial kernel classifier obtained greater result than the result of leukemia classification without dimension reduction method, which the F1-score was 0.9657. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Air transportation network robustness under random and hub-based disruptions,"[{""Penulis"":""Alamsyah, Andry""},{""Penulis"":""Ramadhani, Dian Puteri""}]","Air transportation facilitates important connectivity to drive economic growth and development. Airports and airline companies are considered as two important components in flight activities. Those components construct an interconnected air transportation network. The highly connected network is susceptible against some disruptions. We simulate disruptions in two percolation scenarios, specifically random failures and hub-based attacks. The disruption consequences are examined through network robustness approach. The size of survived connected component and survived link is used as the network robustness measurement. Understanding air transportation network robustness is necessary since the air transportation inefficiency generates a huge level of economic and social costs. Air transportation is a notable and efficient transportation mode in Indonesia since having a wide-spread maritime territory. This research presents an insight of air transportation network robustness under disruptions with domestic flights in Indonesia as a case study and experiment. We discover that flight activities form a scale-free network with heavy-tailed distribution. Air transportation network is robust under random failures but extremely fragile under hub-based attacks. Percolation scenarios facilitate better understanding of disruption consequences on complex air transportation network and support the integrated national air transportation system planning. © 2019 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

A Multi-level Approach for Identifying Process Change in Cancer Pathways,"[{""Penulis"":""Kurniati, Angelina Prima""},{""Penulis"":""McInerney, Ciarán""},{""Penulis"":""Zucker, Kieran""},{""Penulis"":""Hall, Geoff""},{""Penulis"":""Hogg, David""},{""Penulis"":""Johnson, Owen""}]","An understudied challenge within process mining is the area of process change over time. This is a particular concern in healthcare, where patterns of care emerge and evolve in response to individual patient needs and through complex interactions between people, process, technology and changing organisational structure. We propose a structured approach to analyse process change over time suitable for the complex domain of healthcare. Our approach applies a qualitative process comparison at three levels of abstraction: a holistic perspective summarizing patient pathways (process model level), a middle level perspective based on activity sequences for individuals (trace level), and a fine-grained detail focus on activities (activity level). Our aim is to identify points in time where a process changed (detection), to localise and characterise the change (localisation and characterisation), and to understand process evolution (unravelling). We illustrate the approach using a case study of cancer pathways in Leeds Cancer Centre where we found evidence of agreement in process change identified at the process model and activity levels, but not at the trace level. In the experiment we show that this qualitative approach provides a useful understanding of process change over time. Examining change at the three levels provides confirmatory evidence of process change where perspectives agree, while contradictory evidence can lead to focused discussions with domain experts. The approach should be of interest to others dealing with processes that undergo complex change over time. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

These frequencies are potentially used by 5G cellular communication since it has some benefits such as larger bandwidth and capacity. Energy efficiency is a crucial issue in 5G mmWave where it employs a large number of antenna array with power consumed ADCs (Analog to Digital Converters). This paper studies the efficiency of energy for mmWave communication through the optimization of ADC bits quantization. We use Channel Structure-based Scheduling (CSS) algorithm for evaluation with the total rate used as a performance parameter. The selection of quantization bit must consider the complexity of implementation. The simulation uses 2 bits quantization to explore the total rate performance. Then increasing bit number into 3 bits and 5 bits in the following simulation. The total rate increases as transmit power increases for the entire implemented quantization bit number. The random scheduling algorithm is used as a reference for comparison. The simulation shows that Channel structure-based scheduling algorithm outperforms random scheduling. © 2019 IEEE.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Design of a Blockchain-based e-Tendering System: A Case Study in LPSE,"[{""Penulis"":""Yutia, Syifa Nurgaida""},{""Penulis"":""Rahardjo, Budi""}]","The tender process is a long and complex business process to produce a series of legal obligations related to business contracts. The purpose of conducting a tender in government is to support the work program by finding the right tender (provider of goods and services) in the government procurement program so that it can be the basis of their decision to choose the most suitable tender. At the government in Indonesia, the tender process has been carried out using an e-tendering system with the use of internet technology through LPSE. The purpose of e-tendering is to facilitate the procurement process with related parties to increase productivity, effectiveness, and transparency in the tender process. However, problems in the e-tendering system are currently centralized, so that the local LPSE organization has full control of the database and the system which can pose a threat of vulnerability to fraud, collusion, and manipulation practices. The tender selection process that is full of competition must be supported by effective and transparent technology so that it does not cause fraud and suspicion among bidders. Blockchain technology is one of the solutions that allow integrated systems without a third party because it adheres to the decentralized nature of distributed databases so that it has a copy of many users.

Evaluation of Baby Carriers in Indonesia: Physiological and Biomechanical Approach,"[{""Penulis"":""Fista B.""},{""Penulis"":""Widyanti A.""},{""Penulis"":""Muslim K.""},{""Penulis"":""Salma S.A.""}]","Baby carrying is among the most performed activities during mothering and caring for children. Researches showed that baby carrying activities may increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders among mothers. This study aimed to evaluate three types of baby carrier often used by mothers in Indonesia, namely Soft Structured Carrier (SSC), ring sling, and jarik based on the posture analysis approach, Rate of Perceived Discomfort (RPD), Activities-Specific Balanced Confidence Scale (ABC Scale) and heart rate. This research was conducted through laboratory experiments involving 12 respondents. Each respondent was asked to carry out a simulation carrying a 6 months old baby (weighing 7.3 kg) by walking on a treadmill for 10 minutes using three different types of baby carrier. Body markers for posture analysis and heart rate sensor were installed prior to the experiment to record body motion and heart rate, respectively. At the end of the experiment, respondents were asked to provide an assessment of the perceived pain using the RPD questionnaire, as well as the ABC Scale questionnaire to obtain the level of confidence in balance when carrying a baby. The results indicated that through posture analysis, all types of baby carrier produced an average value of 490 - 520 at the sagittal shoulder angle, which falls in the normal posture category. Whereas in the craniohorizontal angle, the SSC type sling provided the best change in posture. Based on the RPD questionnaire, ring sling and jarik resulted in higher pain to the left shoulder than the SSC sling. Based on the results of the ABC scale questionnaire, the SSC sling provided a higher level of trust than the jarik and ring sling. However, no significant difference found in terms of heart rate for the three types of baby carrier. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Prototype of automation of organic fertilizer manufacturing systems based on internet of things,"[{""Penulis"":""Pratama, Yogie Fajar""},{""Penulis"":""Ariyanto, Endro""},{""Penulis"":""Karimah, Siti Amatullah""}]","Compost is an organic fertilizer made from the remnants of plants, animals and decomposable domestic waste with help from decomposers. The process to make compost is still manually done. Organic remnants and waste are piled and buried to create heat during the composting process. Then, the pile is mixed with hand and shovel to control moisture and temperature. Since ideal temperature and humidity have to be estimated manually, it will affect the decomposing duration. Compost will take more time to make if the mixing process and heat are not distributed well. Based on those problems, this research devises an automatic compost maker prototype which can detect temperature and humidity in the composting process based on Internet of Things, so the data can be processed by fuzzy logic, which also acts as the main control to run the actuator (heater and water pump). Temperature and humidity data from the sensor will be sent to a database, then the fuzzy logic will determine the optimal temperature and humidity for the composting process by activating the actuator which consists of water sprinkler, heater and mixing motor. Based on experiment results, the prototype is able to create compost in 14 days or 2,35 times faster than using the traditional tools that require 33 days. © 2019 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Spatial planning taking into account several aspects such as the number of plots (2D), vertical rooms or apartment (3D) of buildings and access to transport. The realization of this object requires the application of three-dimensional (3D) cadastre. This is essential for property rights to be registered and not superimposed. Traditionally, the cadastre is based on a representation of the 2D terrestrial division, but the 2D cadastre is not appropriate for applying and modelling information about the products. Some researchers have also discussed the options for transitioning 2D to 2D+ or three-dimensional (3D) registrations. According to Behnam et al (2016), the use of Building Information Model (BIM) as a feasible approach for managing land and property information in the administration of multi-storey buildings. Here, BIM is a technology capable of displaying the building's in 3D model which can provide any kind of information inside the building. In this research our focus on surveying and mapping the sustainable development of Balinese building structure based on their indigenous knowledge. From survey results, Bali has a unique building structure in land use terminology. Generally, Balinese people use the concept of Tri Hita Karana (relationship of God, Human and Environment) for building their home. Beside, in Bali, there is a local rule that the high of building has limitation of 15 meters or it should has 5 floors.

There are quite several companies involved in the leather industry, especially in Garut which is very influential in exporting goods abroad. Community awareness on the environment and the existence of international standardization in the form of environmentally friendly certification for an industry is a reason for companies in the leather industry that do not have such certification to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of activities carried out in the company, to meet international standards and obtain environmentally friendly certificates so that can compete with foreign industries. Moreover, the activities carried out in the leather industry are related to chemicals and produce waste that is harmful to the environment. In achieving international standardization, there is a need for a system to monitor the company's business processes to be friendly to the environment. Currently monitoring the company's supply chain such as the process of receiving goods from the procurement to the warehouse, the process of goods going out of the warehouse to be sent by the sales to the customer, and picking in the warehouse after receiving finished goods from the production section is still done manually and not all parts use the system. This causes several problems, including data that is not realtime and the business processes of each part of the company, cannot be integrated and are not properly monitored. This problem can be minimized by the existence of a system that can monitor and integrate the company's business processes by environmentally friendly standards. This research focuses on planning and developing systems in the warehouse section carried out by applying the green warehouse concept based on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). The purpose of this concept is to design information systems in monitoring activities and management of goods in the warehouse that pay attention to environmentally friendly aspects.

Predicting behavior intention to adopt teleconsultation technology (A perspective from the implementation of udoctor at Telkom Indonesia),"[{""Penulis"":""Indrawati""},{""Penulis"":""Ulfa, Melany""},{""Penulis"":""Yogi, Oktora""}]","The use of teleconsultation technology in Indonesia is one of solutions to overcome health service problems caused by gaps of health facilities distribution, especially in Indonesia which has 17,508 islands. To find out the readiness of the adoption of Indonesian society to adopt teleconsultation technology, it is important to identify the key factors influenced behavior intention to start using teleconsultation. One of the teleconsultation in Indonesia is UDoctor, a teleconsultation portal based on triple play (text, voice, & video call). UDoctor had been implemented by Telkom Indonesia since August 2014, but unfortunately the use of UDoctor was still very unsatisfied, even it was only among Telkom’s employees. This study identified and predicted the key factors influenced the behavior intention of Telkom’s employees to use teleconsultation by using a Modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. There were 468 valid data out of 975 data derived from survey using online questionnaire. The valid data were analyzed by using Smart PLS 3.0 and the result revealed that there were five factors of Modified UTAUT which significantly influence the behavior intention of Telkom’s employees to use teleconsultation. The factors ordered from the highest to the lowest influence were Trust (0.363), Performance Expectancy (0.237), Effort Expectancy (0.1), Social Influence (0.095) and Facilitating Condition (0.081). Since the highest factor influenced behavior intention to use UDoctor was Trust, Telkom should make the customers and prospective customers feel secure that Telkom would keep their personal information safely and the staff who give the service were reallycompetence. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

One fundamental problem is providing quality and reliable information services that provide infrastructure support that has the capability and capacity. The provision of this infrastructure can be approached with accurate and complete planning and design. The purpose of this research is to produce infrastructure architecture planning and design that forms infrastructure services. As a service, infrastructure architecture has the duty to provide quality and reliable services for end users. Applications and data which are business processes of government institutions require infrastructure parameters that are presented from the service side perception. One way to present infrastructure services for information services in business processes is by planning right before the implementation and deployment phase. At present, the discussion of infrastructure architecture that is widely used is based on the core functions of infrastructure architecture which are limited to the main development and use. These core functions usually focus on availability and modularity (scalability). Availability is usually discussed in the criticality of services that require infrastructure backup. Whereas modularity is related to an increase in the number of users or services. In this study a collaborative role was added, namely an open contribution to the service delivery cycle from the infrastructure section. This open collaborative method is a strategy to ""develop synergies"" between infrastructure service providers and service users (end-users). © 2019 The Authors.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The wind speed measurement data taken in 3421 seconds are recorded and displayed in graphical form between wind speed (m/s) and time (s). Meanwhile, the solar power measurement data taken in 111 seconds are recorded and displayed in graphical form between solar powers (W/m2) to seconds (s). The lowest wind speed measurement result is 0 m/s for some time and the highest is 3 m/s for 2880 seconds, while for the average measurement result is 1 m/s. While the lowest solar power measurement results are 20 W/m2 for some time and the highest is 770 W/m2 at 14:14:43 (23 s), while for the average measurement is 360 W/m2. Referring to such measurement data, the potential for wind power generation is weak, so it is almost impossible to produce energy efficiently using wind power, as the wind speed must be greater than 4 m/s. While based on the measurement profile of solar power, from time to time can reach 770 W/m2 which has the potential to generate electricity. In addition, based on these two measurement results, they show a nonlinear random profile. Thus the installation of hybrid wind and solar power plants must have a nonlinear control system design. © 2019 Penerbit Akademia Baru.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The capabilities can be fostered when the leader is oriented towards digital technology and market orientation. The role of digital leadership has gained attention for studies to develop innovation and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. Studies have been conducted on dynamic capabilities with focus on the strategy, management and economic literature including the understanding of its driving key to success. However, the study on the role of digital leadership on the development of dynamic capability based on innovation capability and market orientation has not been intensively discussed. It is argued that the development of dynamic capability and innovation capability is strongly driven from a combination of digital leadership and market orientation. Data in this study is taken from a survey conducted on 88 Indonesian telecommunication firms as a unit for analyses. The results show that digital leadership had a strong direct and indirect relationship with dynamic capability, however the strong path in developing capability is determined from the development of innovation capability that is driven from digital leadership based on market orientation. The finding reinforces the role of digital leadership as a critical influence on development of dynamic capability. Future studies are suggested to extend the research by exploring the research model to elaborate more on the impact of collaboration, leveraging a larger sample size and better statistical tools. A longitudinal study on the companies that implement the transformation based on dynamic capabilities is also recommended for future studies. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

This system employed Osmo Base Transceiver Station (OsmoBTS), Osmo Network in the Box (OsmoNITB), Osmo Packet Control Unit (OsmoPCU), Osmo Serving GPRS Support Node (OsmoSGSN) and Osmo Gateway GPRS Support Node (OsmoGGSN) as virtual system. From the performance testing on the system that was implemented, the GPRS service was successfully run via a smartphone. Users can access cellular and GPRS networks through networks which are transmitted by Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices. The smartphone was connected to the internet through the Access Point Name (APN). The implemented system was able to provide quality warranty services such as throughput of 1070.1 bytes, delay of 1.1 seconds and packet loss of 4.3%. © 2019 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"LoRa-based IoT Network Planning for Advanced Metering Infrastructure in Urban, Suburban and Rural Scenario","[{""Penulis"":""Bagariang, Yosia""},{""Penulis"":""Nashiruddin, Muhammad Imam""},{""Penulis"":""Adriansyah, Nachwan Mufti""}]","Internet of Things is predicted to be the future of digital business in Indonesia. The trend of IoT implements on a large scale as more sensors and devices are connected. LoRa is one of the promising applications of the Internet of Things with long-range wireless communication in broad areas. LoRa network deployment in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the most significant components in smart metering which measure and collect data from smart meters to be analyzed utilities distribution and consumption. In the IoT, the scenario must achieve two main goals: efficient communication like massive connectivity and defense against environmental conditions. In this paper, we propose the LoRa for Advanced Metering Infrastructure in three utilities (electric, gas, and water meter) to implement in urban, suburban, and rural areas in case of Medan and surroundings by calculating capacity and coverage planning to find out the optimum number of LoRa gateways. Use the method of forecasting IoT connected devices then predict the amount of LoRa gateways need with two scenarios. The first scenario requires the capacity planning by volume demand of the customer's supply of the system. Meanwhile, the second scenario needs coverage planning mostly depends on the link budget and geographical. The simulation results in Forsk Atoll 3.3.2 indicate that the whole determined areas can serve by the number of gateways that have to obtain within acceptable the mean of best signal levels is-76,28 dBm,-75,7 dBm,-81,67 dBm for the urban, suburban and rural scenario, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

DM-LIMGA: Dual Migration Localized Island Model Genetic Algorithm—a better diversity preserver island model,"[{""Penulis"":""Gozali, Alfian Akbar""},{""Penulis"":""Fujimura, Shigeru""}]","Island Model Genetic Algorithm (IMGA) is a multi-population based GA. IMGA aimed to avoid local optimum by maintaining population (island) diversity using migration. There are several mechanisms of migration and individual selection such as the best (or worst) individual selection, new naturally inspired evolution model, and dynamic migration policy. Migration can delay island (local) convergence and intrinsically preserve diversity. Ironically, migration is also potential to bring overall island (global) convergence, faster. In a certain generation, the migrated individuals among islands will have similar value (genetic drift). So, this work aims to preserve global diversity better by implementing Localized IMGA (LIMGA) and Dual Dynamic Migration Policy (DDMP). LIMGA creates unique evolution trends by using a different kind of GAs for each island. DDMP is a new migration policy which rules the individual migration. DDMP determines the state of an island according to its diversity and attractivity level. By determining its states, DDMP ensures the individual migrating to the correct island dynamically. We call the combination of LIMGA and DDMP as Dual Migration LIMGA (DM-LIMGA). Our experiments show that DM-LIMGA can preserve the diversity better. As its implication, DM-LIMGA can create a more extensive search space and dominates the results among other solvers. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

They often suffer livestock farming losses. The selling price they received from the parties of supplier of cow’s milk where they distribute their products are various. The selling price for milk is around IDR 4,600 to IDR 5,000 per liter depending on the quality of milk. Likewise, for beef, the selling price is around IDR 80,000 to IDR 120,000 per kilogram depending on the period of selling. The selling price they received is considered unable to cover the costs for manufacturing process so that the cattle ranchers felt damaged. Therefore, this research gave a contribution in form of knowledge for the cattle ranchers about determining and calculating the cost of the product, and establishing the selling price by using traditional or conventional method and activity based costing method. In traditional method, all costs were charged against the product, including production costs that were not caused by the product. Meanwhile, the activity based costing method explained about the classification of costs, driver, and the cost driver of the product. Hence, this research suggested the cattle ranchers to adopt the activity based costing method since the ABC (activity-based costing) method is more accurate in determining the classification of costs. In addition, this research also gave a contribution for appropriate selling price for milk and beef. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

However, the complete data i.e. the dataset without missing values to generate interesting rules for the detection system, is the key requirement for any mining technique. Furthermore, it is problematic to capture complete information from the nature of student data, due to high computational time to scan the datasets. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces a relative tolerance relation of rough set (RTRS). The novelty of RTRS is that, unlike previous rough set approaches that use tolerance relation, non-symmetric similarity relation, and limited tolerance relation, it is based on limited tolerance relation by taking account into consideration the relatively precision between two objects and therefore this is the first work that uses relatively precision. Moreover, this paper presents the mathematical properties of the RTRS approach and compares the performance and the existing approaches by using real-world student dataset for classifying university’s student performance. The results show that the proposed approach outperformed the existing approaches in terms of computational time and accuracy. © 2019 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

This study is focused on the influence of the positive IOD in 2012 and El Niño in 2015 on the rainfall in Indonesia using satellite-derived precipitation data. Sea surface temperature (SST), rainfall and wind components, are analyzed to evaluate the detailed evaluation of those events. The results show that, in 2012, the positive IOD develops in July - October and reaches its peak in September. During the positive IOD in 2012, there is a negative SST anomaly in the eastern Indian Ocean (western Sumatra). This causes a shift in the warm water pool to the western Indian Ocean. This shifted warm pool is accompanied by a shift in the convective region, leading to deareased rainfall in the western Sumatra. Mean while, in 2015, El-Niño started to develop from July to November. Negative anomalies of rainfall in the transition period II and the east monsoon season are in line with the SST elevation in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. So that the eastern and central of the Pacific Ocean become to center of low pressure which causes the air in the eastern Pacific Ocean to upward (convection) which will form a clouds that contain water, so that the eastern and central of the Pacific Ocean will experience an increase in the amount of rainfall while in the western of the Pacific Ocean or the eastern of Indonesia will experience a rainfall deficit. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

A multi-label classification on topics of Indonesian news using K-Nearest Neighbor,"[{""Penulis"":""Isnaini, Nikmah""},{""Penulis"":""Adiwijaya""},{""Penulis"":""Mubarok, Mohamad Syahrul""},{""Penulis"":""Bakar, Muhammad Yuslan Abu""}]","News has become a basic human need along with technological and internet developments. This causes the process of disseminating information on the news that switched from print media to the digital era. Another problem that appears when classifying news is multi-label. Multi-label classification is different from single label classification. A single label classification will classify documents into one label only. While multi-label classification can group documents into more than one label. For example, news articles that discuss in detail the early detection of ovarian cancer with a bioinformatics approach may have more than one label such as health, bioinformatics, and women. In this paper, a classification model is developed that can identify classes in each multi-label news article using K-Nearest Neighbor. The advantages of K-Nearest Neighbor are algorithms that are very suitable for multi-label cases; even KNN can be superior to other classifiers.

Unfortunately, this technique is often applied without adhering to the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) standards, so that the risks to the pesticide exposure cannot be avoided. Nowadays, the stakeholder has the difficulties for detecting the risks. The current detection system is still performed manually by involving the related experts to assess the farmers' behavior of pesticide use. This process often spends more times, so that it is impacted on late awareness of the pesticide exposure risk. Due to this, this paper proposed the automatic early detection (ArDeFarm) system with applying Certainty Factor method. This system uses the certainty values acquired from the related experts in order to generate the percentage of the pesticide exposure risk based on the farmers' behavior in the pesticide mixing, loading and application. It is tested by using farmers' behavior data collected from 100 orange farmers in Karo District. Based on the experiment, it is able to identify the pesticide exposure risk faced on farmers in the form of the risk percentage automatically, without relying on the experts.

Wireless mobile broadband technology uses limited resources, namely the frequency spectrum. It is an interesting problem because the frequency spectrum regulates by government, so the allocation is restricted. Not requiring a longer time, the licensed frequency for mobile broadband is becoming increasingly full and facing a problem, namely spectrum scarcity. 3GPP saw this opportunity by launching LTE-Advanced Pro (4.9 G) technology through 3GPP Release-13, namely Licensed Assisted Access (LAA). LAA uses carrier aggregation technology between the licensed band and unlicensed band of 5 GHz. The 5 GHz frequency allocation is for ISM needs. LAA aims to increase network capacity, increase efficiency, and increase downlink speed. Several countries in the world already deploy LAA. However, many countries are still doing a trial of LAA technology, including Indonesia. Indonesia represents one of the largest countries in the world, and the number of a mobile broadband user is one of the largest with the rapid growth of mobile user. Thus LAA deployment in Indonesia is required to face spectrum scarcity.

A comprehensive review and technical guideline for optimal design and operations of fuel cell-based cogeneration systems,"[{""Penulis"":""Ramadhani, Farah""},{""Penulis"":""Hussain, Mohd Azlan""},{""Penulis"":""Mokhlis, Hazlie""}]","The need for energy is increasing from year to year and has to be fulfilled by developing innovations in energy generation systems. Cogeneration is one of the matured technologies in energy generation, which has been implemented since the last decade. Cogeneration is defined as energy generation unit that simultaneously produced electricity and heat from a single primary fuel source. Currently, the implementation of this system has been spread over the world for stationary and mobile power generation in residential, industrial and transportation uses. On the other hand, fuel cells as an emerging energy conversion device are potential prime movers for this cogeneration system due to its high heat production and flexibility in its fuel usage. Even though the fuel cell-based cogeneration system has been popularly implemented in research and commercialization sectors, the review regarding this technology is still limited. Focusing on the optimal design of the fuel cell-based cogeneration system, this study attempts to provide a comprehensive review, guideline and future prospects of this technology. With an up-to-date literature list, this review study becomes an important source for researchers who are interested in developing this system for future implementation. © 2019 by the authors.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
System dynamics perspective of the apps-based transportation ecosystem,"[{""Penulis"":""Mukti, Iqbal Yulizar""},{""Penulis"":""Prambudia, Yudha""}]","Along with the development of ICT, transportation domain in Jakarta is evolving. The blooming of apps-based transportation has become an interesting alternative transportation mode for the citizens. This mode of transportation is diverting the usage of single occupancy travel to a more occupancy travel, such that it is expected to give positive contributions in reducing the traffic congestion. In this regard, policy intervention to the apps-based transportation ecosystem is being implemented by the government to ensure the conducive situation with the other transportation mode. This study provides an analysis of the policy intervention impact to the traffic congestion in Jakarta. A simulation model capturing the dynamic of the apps-based transportation ecosystem is developed using system dynamic approach. The main aspects considered in the model are including the usage of apps-based transportation, the traffic congestion, and the number of vehicles on the road. The simulation of the model is conducted based on four scenarios of policy intervention, namely, empowering, control, limited, and block. By using the data that are relevant to the situation in Jakarta, the simulation result shows that the traffic congestion level will significantly decline when the policy related to the apps-based transportation is supportive. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Indonesian graphemic syllabification using a nearest neighbour classifier and recovery procedure,"[{""Penulis"":""Parande, Edwina Anky""},{""Penulis"":""Suyanto, Suyanto""}]","An automatic syllabification, decomposing a word into syllables, is an important part in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) that uses both syllable-based acoustic and language models. It can be performed to either phoneme or grapheme sequences. The phonemic syllabification is more complex than the other since it requires a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) as a previous process. It generally gives a high accuracy for many formal words but its accuracy may decrease for person-names. In contrast, the graphemic syllabification is simpler and more potential to be applied for person-names. This research focuses on developing a model of graphemic syllabification using a combination of phonotactic rules and Fuzzy k-nearest neighbour in every Class (FkNNC). The phonotactic rules are designed to find some deterministic syllabification points while FkNNC, as a statistical classifier, is expected to search the remaining stochastic syllabification points. A recovery procedure is proposed to correct the wrong syllabification points produced by FkNNC. Fivefold cross-validating on a dataset of 50k formal words, selected from the great dictionary of the Indonesian language, shows that the proposed model gives syllable error rate (SER) of 2.48% and the proposed recovery procedure reduces the SER to be 2.27%, which is higher than that produced by the phonemic syllabification (only 0.99%). But, this model is capable of handling a dataset of 15k high variance person-names with SER of 7.45% and the proposed recovery procedure reduces the SER to be 6.78%. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

The system is expected to perform more complex traffic arrangements, in particular traffic management of emergency vehicles. Implementation with traffic signal pre-emption alone is not enough to give space for the emergency vehicle to cross an intersection safely, especially if the lane street has only one lane. The paper proposes a new model of traffic discharge acceleration based on queueing theory approach. In the proposed model, two performance indicators are introduced which are: speed of normal traffic in front of the emergency vehicle and travelling time of the emergency vehicle. The aim is that the emergency vehicle could reach a destination within a certain time and a constant speed. Moreover, the delay should be managed to a minimum. Linear and exponential acceleration formulas of the traffic in front of the emergency vehicle are derived and then validated. Performances of the model are tested against the models in the literature. Simulation results show the proposed model leads to better assurance that emergency vehicle is not delayed significantly.

Optimal Planning of Solar PV Using Simple Model for New Feed-in Tariff in Indonesia,"[{""Penulis"":""Adam, Kharisma Bani""},{""Penulis"":""Miyauchi, Hajime""}]","Indonesia is still struggling to attract the investor to involve in solar photovoltaic (PV) project. There is a rapid transformation in PV regulation by the government. Four regulation related to solar PV is delivered from 2016 until 2018. In 2018, the feed-in tariff regulation was established. The feed-in tariff aims the electricity customer to install the PV system and inject the excess energy to the grid. However, this rapid regulation changing is not yet attracting developer nor customer to invest in the solar PV. This paper proposes a simple model to calculate the optimal size of PV for new feed-in tariff regulation in Indonesia. Feed-in tariff regulation allows the customer to inject the energy produced by PV to the grid. The regulation provides 65% compensation of electricity price from energy sent to the grid with several limitations. There is difficulty to estimate daily energy data. Then, a technical calculation is proposed by using a simple model so that it can help the customer in sizing the solar PV system. Adding to the proposal of the methodology, this research also develops an application to help customers in calculating the optimal size of solar PV and its profitability. The new feed-in tariff rule will be an attraction for the customer. However, it needs a comprehensive calculation so that solar PV can be profitable. Oversized PV systems can cause financial losses with the large investment and limitation on the calculation of energy injected into the grid. The result shows that the PV simple model is successfully developed to help the consumer obtain the optimal PV size. © 2019 IEEE.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Labor Market and Household Debt in Asia Pacific Countries: Dynamic Heterogeneous Panel Data Analysis,"[{""Penulis"":""Kusairi, Suhal""},{""Penulis"":""Muhamad, Suriyani""},{""Penulis"":""Musdholifah, M""},{""Penulis"":""Chang, Shu-Chen""}]","An overwhelming increase in household debt in the last decade has stirred researchers to explore the determinants of this phenomena, especially the role of the labor market. This paper comes to identify these determinants using the macro panel data from Asia Pacific countries for 1994-2016 and dynamic heterogeneous panel data analysis. The empirical results found that household consumption, housing price index, and labor force have a long-run positive relationship with household debt. In contrast, the unemployment rate and dependency ratio have a long-run negative relationship with household debt. This implies that when consumption, housing price, and labor force increase, then the household debt will increase, and when the unemployment rate and dependency ratio increase, the household debt will decrease. Also, in the short-run, public debt does affect private consumption, and it is not different among countries. The labor market, as represented by the unemployment rate, dependency ratio, and labor force, has a strong effect on the household debt in the long-run. Based on these findings, the government should pay more attention to the household debt related to property and commodity markets because they expose the short-run volatility and create problems for the long-term. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Comparison between least effort and random walk in combined shipping service,"[{""Penulis"":""Kusuma, Purba Dam""}]","Now a days, city courier service is very popular, especially in Indonesia. This popularity is also boosted by the rise of online motorcycle taxi service. By using city courier service, local shipment can be delivered faster rather than regular courier service. One problem in this service is the combined shipping method has not implemented yet. So, for customer who sends more than one package to more than one destination, the cost is still calculated in regular price without any reduction. The other problem is even there is more than one shipment, customer has to create order one by one and the packages will be delivered by different driver. So, developing combined shipping system will benefit the customer and the driver. In this research, we propose combined shipping model for city courier service by comparing two methods: least effort and random walk algorithm. In this study, we compare the performance of combined shipping that uses least effort or random walk method and conventional one to one shipping model. In this research, we found that combined shipping that implements least effort algorithm produces the best performance both in non financial aspect and financial aspect. By using least effort algorithm, system generates lowest total driver travel distance and highest average driver's travel distance. The financial consequence is lowest total cost that must be paid by customer and highest average driver's revenue. © Medwell Journals, 2019.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Intervening role of innovation management on relationship between digital leadership and dynamic capability accelerated by collaboration,"[{""Penulis"":""Elidjen""},{""Penulis"":""Mihardjo, Leonardus W. Wasono""},{""Penulis"":""Rukmana, Riza A.N.""}]","Digital technology has driven changes in markets and consumers. The market has become more dynamic due to new business model innovations offered by new entries in the industry. Incumbent firms require a digital transformation in order to have a more dynamic capability in shaping their existing business to fit the new paradigm. The fastest way of developing capabilities to align with the new paradigm is through collaboration with partners. Developing capabilities for innovation management and dynamic capabilities requires strong digital leadership to optimize the use of digital technology. The need for collaboration is urgent to accelerate the development process of innovation in the digital era, therefore, this study uses collaboration as its moderating variable. Most published research focusing on digital transformation examines digital leadership, innovation dynamic capabilities based on construct, applicability and benefit, and the role of collaboration. However, the role of digital leadership in driving innovation management and dynamic capability has not been intensively explored nor specifically the influence of collaboration. This study was conducted through a survey of 88 senior leader respondents from Indonesian telecommunication firms using a purposive sampling method. The statistical data was processed using Smart-PLS application for analyses. Findings demonstrate that innovation management moderated by collaboration had a significant influence in accelerating the relationship between digital leadership and dynamic capabilities. It is also found that digital leadership had a direct and indirect impact on the development of dynamic capability. This indicates that digital leadership actually had a strong role in driving the transformation. These findings have practical implications to support the theory that collaboration is a critical factor in the digital era. It supports the role of firm management in strengthening digital leadership capabilities in conjunction with the development of innovation management with a focus on co-creation values in developing dynamic capabilities. Recommendation for further research is also discussed in this paper. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

There are more than 40 CMIP5 GCMs data available, but no single model can be considered as the best for every region. The use of CMIP5 GCMs data for rainfall projection in Indonesia is important to improve the accuracy of the monthly and seasonal rainfall forecast. Then, this study evaluates the capability of the CMIP5 GCMs data for Indonesia region by quantitatively comparing the spatial pattern of the precipitation mean and standard deviation of the CMIP5 data against GPCP, GPCC, and CRU data in the period 1980-2005. Furthermore, the composite analysis is conducted to observe the model performance in reproducing the precipitation characteristic over some areas in Indonesia. In conclusion, the models NorESM1-M, NorESM1-ME, GFDL-ESM2M, CSIRO-MK3-6-0 perform the rainfall mean better than others, while the standard deviation of the rainfall show that the models NorESM1-M, BNU-ESM, CMCC-CMS are superior in which NorESM1-M gives the best performance. The annual precipitation pattern of the model NorESM1-M over various areas in Indonesia is also highly correlated with the observations.
